<p>A handful of men, frugal, hardy,
and valiant, successfully defending
their barren mountains and dearly-won
independence against the reiterated
assaults of a mighty neighbour,
offer, apart from political considerations,
a deeply interesting spectacle.
When, upon a map of the world's
eastern hemisphere, we behold, not
far from its centre, on the confines of
barbarism and civilisation, a spot,
black with mountains, and marked
"Circassia;" when we contrast this
petty nook with the vast territory
stretching from the Black Sea to the
Northern Ocean, from the Baltic to
Behring's Straits, we admire and wonder
at the inflexible resolution and
determined gallantry that have so
long borne up against the aggressive
ambition, iron will, and immense resources
of a czar. Sixty millions
against six hundred thousand&mdash;a hundred
to one, a whole squadron against
a single cavalier, a colossus opposed
to a pigmy&mdash;these are the odds at
issue. It seems impossible that such
a contest can long endure. Yet it
has lasted twenty years, and still the
dwarf resists subjugation, and contrives,
at intervals, to inflict severe
punishment upon his gigantic adversary.
There is something strangely
exciting in the contemplation of so
brave a struggle. Its interest is far
superior to that of any of the "little
wars" in which Europe, since 1815,
has evaporated her superabundant
pugnacity. African raids and Spanish
skirmishes are pale affairs contrasted
with the dashing onslaughts of the
intrepid Circassians. And, in other
respects than its heroism, this contest
merits attention. As an important
section of the huge mountain-dyke,
opposed by nature to the south-eastern
extension of the Russian empire, Circassia
is not to be overlooked. On
the rugged peaks and in the deep valleys
of the Caucasus, her fearless warriors
stand, the vedettes of southern
Asia, a living barrier to the forward
flight of the double eagle.</p>

<p>Matters of pressing interest, nearer
home, have diverted public attention
from the warlike Circassians, whose
independent spirit and unflinching
bravery deserves better than even
temporary oblivion. Not in our day
only have they distinguished themselves
in freedom's fight. Surrounded
by powerful and encroaching potentates,
their history, for the last five
hundred years, records constant
struggles against oppression. Often
conquered, they never were fully subdued.
Their obscure chronicles are
illumined by flashes of patriotism and
heroic courage. Early in the fifteenth
century, they conquered their freedom
from the Georgian yoke. Then came
long wars with the Tartars, who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
hardly, perhaps, be considered the
aggressors, the Circassians having
overstepped their mountain limits,
and spread over the plains adjacent
to the Sea of Azov. In 1555, the
Russian grand-duke, Ivan Vasilivitch,
pressed forward to Tarki upon the
Caspian, where he placed a garrison.
A Circassian tribe submitted to him;
he married the daughter of one of
their princes, and assisted them
against the Tartars. But after a
while the Russians withdrew their
succour; and the Circassians, driven
back to the river Kuban, their natural
boundary to the north-west, paid
tribute to the Tartars, till the commencement
of the eighteenth century,
when a decisive victory liberated them.
Meanwhile Russia strode steadily
southwards, reached the Kuban in the
west, whilst, in the east, Tarki and
Derbent fell, in 1722, into the hands
of Peter the Great. The fort of
Swiatoi-Krest, built by the conqueror,
was soon afterwards retaken by a
swarm of fanatical mountaineers from
the eastern Caucasus. It is now
about seventy years since Russian
and Circassian first crossed swords in
serious warfare. A fanatic dervise,
who called himself Sheikh Mansour,
preached a religious war against the
Muscovites; but, although followed
with enthusiasm, his success was not
great, and at last he was captured
and sent prisoner into the interior of
Russia. With his fall the furious
zeal of the Caucasians subsided for a
while. But the Turks, who viewed
Circassia as their main bulwark
against the rapidly increasing power
of their dangerous northern neighbour,
made friends of the mountaineers,
and stirred them up against
Russia. The fortified town of Anapa,
on the north-west coast of Circassia,
became the focus of the intercourse
between the Porte and its new allies.
The creed of Mahomet was actively
propagated amongst the Circassians,
whose relations with Turkey grew
more and more intimate, and in the
year 1824 several tribes took oath of
allegiance to the sultan. In 1829,
during the war between Russia and
Turkey, Anapa, which had more than
once changed hands in the course of
previous contests, was taken by the
former power, to whom, by the treaty
of Adrianople, its possession, and that
of the other Turkish posts on the same
coast, was finally conceded. Hence
the chief claim of Russia upon Circassia&mdash;although
Circassia had never
belonged to the Turks, nor been occupied
by them; and from that period
dates the war that has elicited from
Russia so great a display of force
against an apparently feeble, but in
reality formidable antagonist&mdash;an
antagonist who has hitherto baffled
her best generals, and picked troops,
and most skilful strategists.</p>

<p>The tribes of the Caucasus may be
comprehended, for the sake of simplicity,
under two denominations:
the Tcherkesses or Circassians, in
the west, and the Tshetshens in the
east. In loose newspaper statements,
and in the garbled reports of the
war which remote position, Russian
jealousy, and the peculiarly inaccessible
character of the Caucasians,
suffer to reach us, even this broad
distinction is frequently disregarded.[A]
It is nevertheless important, at least
in a physiological point of view;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and, even as regards the resistance
offered to Russia, there are differences
between the Eastern and the
Western Caucasians. The military
tactics of both are much alike, but the
character of the war varies. On the
banks of the Kuban, and on the Euxine
shores, the strife has never been
so desperate, and so dangerous for the
Russians, as in Daghestan, Lesghistan,
and the land of the Tshetshens.
The Abchasians, Mingrelians, and
other Circassian tribes, dwelling on
the southern slopes of Caucasus, and
on the margin of the Black Sea, are
of more peaceable and passive character
than their brethren to the North
and East. The Tshetshens, by far
the most warlike and enterprising of
the Caucasians, have had the ablest
leaders, and have at all times been
stimulated by fierce religious zeal. As
far back as 1745, Russian missionaries
were sent to the tribe of the Osseti,
who had relapsed from Christianity
to the heathen creed of their forefathers.
Every Osset who presented
himself at the baptismal font received
a silver cross and a new shirt. The
bait brought thousands of the mountaineers
to the Russian priests, who
contented themselves with the outward
and visible sign of conversion. These
propagandist attempts enraged the Mahomedan
tribes, and then it was that
they thronged around Sheikh Mansour,
as they have done in our day (in 1830)
around that strange fanatic Chasi-Mollah,
when in his turn he preached a
holy war against the Russian. In the
latter year, General Paskewitch had
just been called away to Poland, and
his successor, Baron Rosen, found all
Daghestan in an uproar. He immediately
opened the campaign, but met
a strenuous resistance, and suffered
heavy loss. The defence of the village
of Hermentschuk, held against him,
in the year 1832, by 3000 Tshetshens,
was an extraordinary example of heroism.
When the Russian infantry
forced their way into the place with
the bayonet, a portion of the garrison
shut themselves up in a fortified house,
and made it good against overwhelming
numbers, singing passages from
the Koran amidst a storm of bombs and
grapeshot. At last the building took
fire, and its undaunted defenders, the
sacred verses still upon their lips,
found death in the flames. In an
equally desperate defence of the fortified
village of Himri, Chasi-Mollah
met his death, falling in the very
breach, bleeding from many wounds.
The chief who succeeded him was less
venerated and less energetic, and for
a few years the Tshetshens remained
tolerably quiet, but without a thought
of submission. Nevertheless the Russians
flattered themselves that the worst
was past; that the death of the mad
dervish was an irreparable loss to the
mountaineers. They were mistaken.
Out of his most ardent adherents Chasi-Mollah
had formed a sort of sacred
band, whom he called Murides, gloomy
fanatics, half warriors, half priests.
They composed his body-guard, were
unwearied in preaching up the fight
for the Prophet's faith, and in battle
devoted themselves to death with a
heroism that has never been surpassed.
From these, within a short time of
their first leader's death, Chamyl, the
present renowned chief of the Tshetshens,
soon stood forth pre-eminent,
and the Murides followed him to the
field with the same enthusiasm and
valour they had shown under his predecessor.
He did not prove less worthy
of guiding them; and the Russians
were compelled to confess, that
it was easier for the Tshetshens to
find an able leader than for them to
find a general able to beat him. And
victories over the restless and enterprising
Caucasians were of little profit,
even when obtained. For the
most part, they only served to fill the
Russian hospitals, and to procure the
officers those ribbons and distinctions
they so greedily covet, and which, in
that service, are so liberally bestowed.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Thus, in 1845, Count Woronzoff
made a most daring expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
into the heart of Daghestan. He found
the villages empty and in flames, lost
three thousand men, amongst them
many brave and valuable officers, and
marched back again, strewing the path
with wounded, for whom the means
of transport (the horses of the Cossack
cavalry) were quite insufficient. With
great difficulty, and protected by a
column that went out to meet them,
the Russians regained their lines, harassed
to the last by the fierce Caucasians.
This affair was called a victory,
and Count Woronzoff was made
a prince. Two more such victories
would have reduced his expeditionary
column to a single battalion. Chamyl,
who had cannonaded the Russians
with their own artillery, captured in
former actions, possibly considered
himself equally entitled to triumph,
as he slowly retreated, after following
up the foe nearly to the gates of their
fortresses, into the recesses of his native
valleys.
<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The interior of Circassia is still an
unknown land. The investigations of
Messrs Bell, Longworth, Stewart, and
others, who of late years have visited
and written about the country, were
confined to small districts, and cramped
by the jealousy of the natives. Mr
Bell, who made the longest residence,
was treated more like a prisoner than
a guest. Other foreigners find a worse
reception still. Even the Poles, who
desert from the Russian army, are
made slaves of by the Circassians, and
so severely treated that they are often
glad to return to their colours, and
endure the flogging that there awaits
them. The only European who,
having penetrated into the interior,
has again seen his own country, is the
Russian Baron Turnau, an aide-de-camp
of General Gurko; but the circumstances
of his abode in Circassia
were too painful and peculiar to allow
opportunity for observation. They
are well told by Dr Wagner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"By the Emperor's command, Russian
officers acquainted with the language are
sent, from time to time, as spies into Circassia,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;partly
to make topographical
surveys of districts previously unknown;
partly to ascertain the numbers, mode
of life, and disposition of those tribes
with whom no intercourse is kept up.
These missions are extremely dangerous,
and seldom succeed. Shortly before
my arrival at Terek, four Russian
staff-officers were sent as spies to various
parts of Lesghistan. They assumed
the Caucasian garb, and were attended
by natives in Russian pay. Only
one of them ever returned; the three
others were recognised and murdered.
Baron Turnau prepared himself long
beforehand for his dangerous mission. He
gave his complexion a brownish tint, and
to his beard the form affected by the aborigines.
He also tried to learn the language
of the Ubiches, but, finding the
harsh pronunciation of certain words quite
unattainable, he agreed with his guide to
pass for deaf and dumb during his stay
in the country. In this guise he set out
upon his perilous journey, and for several
days wandered undetected from tribe to
tribe. But one of the <em>works</em> (nobles) under
whose roof he passed a night, conceived
suspicions, and threatened the
guide, who betrayed his employer's secret.
The baron was kept prisoner, and the
Ubiches demanded a cap-full of silver for
his ransom from the Russian commandant
of Fort Ardler. When this officer
declared himself ready to pay, they
increased their demand to a bushel of
silver rubles. The commandant referred
the matter to Baron Rosen, then commander-in-chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of the army of the Caucasus;
the baron reported it to St Petersburg,
and the Emperor consented to pay
the heavy ransom. But Rosen represented
it to him as more for the Russian
interest to leave Turnau for a while in
the hands of the Ubiches; for, in the first
place, the payment of so large a sum was
a bad precedent, likely to encourage the
mountaineers to renew the extortion, instead
of contenting themselves, as they
previously had done, with a few hundred
rubles; and, secondly, as a prisoner,
Baron Turnau would perhaps have opportunities
of gathering valuable information
concerning a country and people of whom
little or nothing was known. The unfortunate
young officer was cruelly sacrificed
to these considerations, and passed a long
winter in terrible captivity, tortured by
frost and hunger, compelled, as a slave,
to the severest labour, and often greatly
ill-treated. Several attempts at flight
failed; and at last the chief, in whose
hands he was, confined him in a cage
half-buried in the ground, and withal so
narrow that its inmate could neither
stand upright nor lie at length."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus immured, a prey to painful
maladies, his clothes rotting on his
emaciated limbs, the unhappy man
moaned through his long and sleepless
nights, and gave up hope of rescue.
No tender-hearted Circassian maiden
brought to him, as to the hero of
Pushkin's well-known Caucasian
poem, deliverance and love. Such
luck had been that of more than one
Russian captive; but poor Turnau, in
his state of filth and squalor, was no
very seductive object. He might have
pined away his life in his cage, before
Baron Rosen, or his paternal majesty
the Czar, had recalled his fate to mind,
but for an injury done by his merciless
master to one of his domestics,
who vowed revenge. Watching his
opportunity, this servant, one day that
the rest of the household were absent,
murdered his lord, released the prisoner,
tied him with thongs upon his
saddle, upon which the baron, covered
with sores and exhausted by illness,
was unable to support himself, and
galloped with him towards the frontier.
In one day they rode eighty
<em>versts</em>, (about fifty-four English miles,)
outstripped pursuers, and reached
Fort Ardler. The accounts given by
Baron Turnau of the land of his captivity
could be but slight: he had
seen little beyond his place of confinement.
What he did relate was not
very encouraging to Russian invasion.
He depicted the country as one mass
of rock and precipice, partially clothed
with vast tracts of aboriginal forest,
broken by deep ravines and mountain
torrents, and surmounted by the huge
ice-clad pinnacles of the loftiest Caucasian
ridge. The villages, some of
which nestle in the deep recesses of
the woods, whilst others are perched
upon steep crags and on the brink of
giddy precipices, are universally of
most difficult access.</p>

<p>Dr Wagner, whose extremely
amusing book forms the text of this
article, has never been in Circassia,
although he gives us more information
about it, of the sort we want,
than any traveller in that singular
land whose writings have come under
our notice. His wanderings were
under Russian guidance and escort.
During them, he skirted the hostile
territory on more than one side;
occasionally setting a foot across the
border, to the alarm of his Cossacks,
whose dread by day and dreams
by night were of Circassian ambuscades;
he has lingered at the base
of Caucasus, and has traversed its
ranges&mdash;without, however, deeming it
necessary to penetrate into those
remote valleys, where foreigners find
dubious welcome, and whence they are
not always sure of exit. He has
mixed much with Circassians, if he
has not actually dwelt in their villages.
It were tedious and unnecessary
to detail his exact itinerary.
He has not printed his entire journal&mdash;according
to the lazy and egotistical
practice of many travellers&mdash;but
has taken the trouble to condense it.
The essence is full of variety, anecdote
and adventure, and gives a clear
insight into the nature of the war.
Professedly a man of science, an antiquary
and a naturalist, Dr Wagner
has evidently a secret hankering after
matters military. He loves the sound
of the drum, and willingly directs his
scientific researches to countries where
he is likely to smell powder. We
had heard of him in the Atlas mountains,
and at the siege of Constantina,
before we met him risking his neck
along the banks of the Kuban, and
across the wild steppes of the Caucasus.
He has travelled much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
East, and prepared himself for his
Caucasian trip by a long stay in
Turkey and in Southern Russia.
Well introduced, he derived from
distinguished Russian generals, intelligent
civilians, and Circassian chiefs,
particulars of the war more authentic
than are to be obtained either from
St Petersburg bulletins, or from the
ordinary trans-Caucasian correspondents
of German and other newspapers,
many of whom are in the pay
of Russia. His African reminiscences
proved of great value. The officers
of the army of Caucasus take the
strongest interest in the contest between
French and Arabs, finding in
it, doubtless, points of similitude with
the war in which they themselves are
engaged. Amongst these officers he
met, besides Russians and Germans,
several naturalised Poles and Frenchmen,
Flemings and Spaniards, who
gave in exchange for his tales of
razzias and Bedouins, details of Circassian
warfare which he highly
prized, as likely to be more impartial
than the accounts afforded by the
native Russians. His own journey to
the Caucasus took place in 1843; but
a subsequent correspondence with
well-informed friends, on both sides
the Caucasian range, enabled him to
bring down his sketch of the struggle
to the year 1846.</p>

<p>Many English writers on Circassia
have been accused of an undue preference
for the mountaineers, of exaggerating
their good qualities, and of
elevating them by invidious contrasts
with the Russians. There is no
ground for suspecting a German of
such partiality; and Dr Wagner,
whilst lauding the heroic valour and
independent spirit of the Circassians&mdash;qualities
which Russian authors
have themselves admitted and extolled&mdash;does
not forget to do justice to
his Muscovite and Cossack friends,
to whom he devotes a considerable
portion of his book, many of his
details concerning them being extremely
novel and curious. He carefully
studied both Cossacks and Circassians,
living amongst the former
and meeting thousands of the latter,
who go and come freely upon Russian
territory. At Ekaterinodar, the capital
of the Tchernamortsy Cossacks,
the Friday's market swarmed with
Circassians. In Turkey, and elsewhere,
Dr Wagner had met many
individuals of that nation, but this
was the first time he beheld them in
crowds. He describes them as very
handsome men, with black beards,
aquiline noses, and flashing black
eyes. He was struck with their lofty
mien, and attributes it to their mental
energy, and to a consciousness of
physical strength and beauty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This superiority of the pure Circassian
blood does not belie itself under
Russian discipline, any more than it does
in Mahometan lands, where, as Mamelukes
in Cairo, and as pashas in Stamboul,
the sons of Caucasus have ever
played a prominent and distinguished
part. The Turk, who by certain imposing
qualities awes all other Orientals,
tacitly recognises the superiority of the
Circassian <i>ousden</i>, or noble. The Emperor
Nicholas, who preserves so rigid a
discipline in the various corps of his
vast army, shows himself extraordinarily
considerate towards the Circassian squadrons
of his guard. Persons well versed
in the military chronicles of St Petersburg
relate many a characteristic trait,
proving the bold stubborn spirit of these
Caucasian men to be still unbroken, and
showing how it more than once has so imposed
upon the emperor, and even upon
the grand-duke Michael, reputed the strictest
disciplinarian in Russia, that they have
shut their eyes even to open mutiny.
At a review, where the Caucasian cavalry
formally refused obedience, the emperor
contented himself with sending a courteous
reproof by General Benkendorf.
Beside the coarse common Russians, the
Circassian looks like an eagle amidst a
flock of bustards. Even capital crimes
are not visited upon Circassians with the
same severity as upon the other subjects
of the emperor. A Circassian who had
struck his dagger into the heart of a
hackney-coachman at St Petersburg, in
requital of an insolent overcharge, was
merely sent back to the Caucasus. For
a like offence a Russian might reckon
upon the knout, and upon banishment
for life to the Siberian mines.</p>

<p>"Amongst the Circassians at Ekaterinodar,
a <em>work</em>, or noble, of the Shapsookian
tribe, was particularly remarkable
for his beauty and dignity. None
of the picturesque figures of Arabs and
Moors furnished me by my African recollections,
could bear comparison with this
Caucasian eagle. I afterwards saw, in
Mingrelia, a more ideal mould of feature,
resembling the antique Apollo type:
but there the expression was too effeminate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the heroic head of the dweller on
the Kuban pleased me better. I stood
a good while before the Shapsookian, as
if fettered to the ground, so extraordinary
was the effect of his striking beauty.
What a study, I thought, for a German
painter, who would in vain seek such
models in Rome; or for a Vernet, whose
Arabian groups prove the great power of
his pencil! The Arabs, rather priestly
than knightly in their aspect, produce
far less effect upon the large Algerine
pictures at Versailles than the Circassian
warrior would do in a battle-piece by
such masters as Vernet or Peter Hess.
The Shapsook chief at Ekaterinodar
seemed conscious of his magnificent appearance.
With proud mien, and that
light half-gliding gait observable in
most Caucasians, he sauntered amongst
the groups of Cossacks upon the market-place,
casting glances of profoundest
scorn upon their clumsy sheepskin-wrapped
figures. His slender form and
small foot, the grace and elegance of his
person and carriage, the richness of his
costume and beauty of his weapons, contrasted
most advantageously with the
muscular but somewhat thickset figures,
and with the ugly woolly winter dress of
the Tchernamortsies. By help of a Cossack
I made his acquaintance, and got
into conversation. His name was Chora-Beg,
and he dwelt at a hamlet thirty
versts south of Ekaterinodar."</p></blockquote>

<p>Chora-Beg wondered greatly that
his new acquaintance was neither
Russian nor English. He had heard
vaguely that there was a third Christian
nation, which, under Sultan
Bunapart, had made war upon the
Padisha of the Russians, but he had
no notion of such a people as the
Germans. He greatly admired Dr
Wagner's rifle, but rather doubted its
carrying farther than a smooth bore,
and allowed free inspection of his own
arms, consisting of pistols and dagger,
and of the famous <i>shaska</i>&mdash;a long
heavy cavalry sabre, slightly curved,
with hilt of silver and ivory. At the
doctor's request he drew this weapon
from the scabbard, and cut twice or
thrice at the empty air, his dark eyes
flashing as he did so. "How many
Russians has that sabre sent to their
account?" asked the inquisitive Doctor.
The Circassian's intelligent
countenance assumed an expression
hard to interpret, but in which his
interlocutor thought he distinguished
a gleam of scorn, and a shade of suspicion.
"It was long," he replied,
"since his tribe had taken the field
against the Russians. Since the deaf
general (Sass) had left the land of the
Cossacks, peace had reigned between
Muscovite and Shapsookian. Individuals
of his tribe had certainly been
known to join bands from the mountains,
and to cross the Kuban with
arms in hand." And as Chora-Beg
spoke, the expression of his proud eye
belied his pacific pretensions.</p>

<p>The general Sass above-named
commanded for several years on the
line of the Kuban, and is the only
Russian general who has understood
the mountain warfare, and proved
himself a match for the Circassians at
their own game of ambuscades and
surprises. His tactics were those of
the Spanish guerilla leaders. Lavish
in his payment of spies, he was always
accurately informed of the musters
and projects of the Circassians;
whilst he kept his own plans so secret,
that his personal staff often knew nothing
of an intended expedition until
the call to "boot and saddle" sounded.
His raids were accomplished, under
guidance of his well-paid scouts, with
such rapidity and local knowledge that
the mountaineers rarely had time to
assemble in force, pursue the retiring
column, and revenge their burnt vilages
and ravished cattle. But one
day the report spread on the lines of
the Kuban that the general was dangerously
ill; shortly afterwards it
became known that the physicians
had given him up; and finally his
death was announced, and bewailed
by the whole army of the Caucasus.
The consternation of the Cossacks,
accustomed, under his command, to
victory and rich booty, was as great
as the exultation of the mountaineers.
Hundreds of these visited the Russian
territory, to witness the interment of
their dreaded foe. A magnificent
coffin, with the general's cocked hat
and decorations laid upon it, was deposited
in the earth amidst the mournful
sounds of minute guns and muffled
drums. With joyful hearts the Circassians
returned to their mountains,
to tell what they had seen, and to congratulate
each other at the prospect of
tranquillity for themselves, and safety
to their flocks and herds. But upon
the second night after Sass's funeral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a strong Russian column crossed the
Kuban, and the dead general suddenly
appeared at the head of his trusty
lancers, who greeted with wild hurrahs
their leader's resurrection. Several
large <i>auls</i> (villages) whose inhabitants
were sound asleep, unsuspicious of
surprise, were destroyed, vast droves
of cattle were carried off, and a host
of prisoners made. This ingenious
and successful stratagem is still cited
with admiration on the banks of the
Kuban. Notwithstanding his able
generalship, Sass was removed from
his command when in full career of
success. All his military services
could not shield him from the consequences
of St Petersburg intrigues and
trumped-up accusations. None of his
successors have equalled him. General
Willaminoff was a man of big
words rather than of great deeds. In
his bombastic and blasphemous proclamation
of the 28th May 1837, he
informed the Circassians that "If the
heavens should fall, Russia could prop
them with her bayonets;" following
up this startling assertion with the
declaration that "there are but two
powers in existence&mdash;God in heaven,
and the emperor upon earth!"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
Circassians laughed at this rhodomontade,
and returned a firm and becoming
answer. There were but few of
them, they said&mdash;but, with God's blessing,
they would hold their own, and
fight to the very last man: and to
prove themselves as good as their
word, they soon afterwards made
fierce assaults upon the line of forts
built by the Russians upon the shores
of the Black Sea. In 1840 four of
these were taken, but the triumph cost
the victors so much blood as to disgust
them for some time with attacking
stone walls, behind which the Russians,
perhaps the best defensive combatants
in the world, fight like lions.
Indeed, the Circassians would hardly
have proved victorious, had not the
garrisons been enfeebled by disease.
During the five winter months, the rations
of the troops employed upon this
service are usually salt, and the consequences
are scurvy and fever. Informed
by Polish deserters of the bad
condition of the garrisons, the Circassians
held a great council in the
mountains, and it was decided to take
the forts with the sabre, without firing
a shot. It is an old Caucasian custom,
that, upon suchlike perilous undertakings,
a chosen band of enthusiastic
warrors devote themselves to
death, binding themselves by a solemn
oath not to turn their backs upon the
enemy. Ever in the van, their example
gives courage to the timid; and
their friends are bound in honour to
revenge their death. With these
fanatics have the Circassian and
Tshetshen chiefs achieved their greatest
victories over the Russians.</p>

<p>When it was decided to attack the
forts, several hundred Shapsookians,
including gray-haired old men and
youths of tender age, swore to conquer
or to die. They kept their word.
At the fort of Michailoff, which made
the most obstinate defence, the ditch
was filled with their corpses. The
conduct of the garrison was truly
heroic. Of five hundred men, only
one third were fit for duty; the others
were in hospital, or on the sick-list.
But no sooner did the Circassian war-cry
rend the air than the sufferers
forgot their pains; the fever-stricken
left their beds, and crawled to the
walls. Their commandant called upon
them to shed their last drop of blood
for their emperor; their old <em>papa</em> exhorted
them, as Christians, to fight to
the death against the unbelieving
horde. But numbers prevailed: after
a valiant defence, the Russians retreated,
fighting, to the innermost
enclosures of the fortress. Their chief
demanded a volunteer to blow up the
fort when farther resistance should
become impossible. A soldier stepped
forward, took a lighted match, and
entered the powder magazine. The
last defences were stormed, the Circassians
shouted victory. Then came
the explosion. Most of the buildings
were overthrown, and hundreds of
maimed carcases scattered in all directions.
Eleven Russians escaped
with life, were dragged off to the
mountains, and subsequently ransomed,
and from them the details of this
bloody fight were obtained.</p>

<p>The capture of these forts spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
discouragement and consternation in
the ranks of the Russian army. The
emperor was furious, and General
Rajewski, then commander-in-chief on
the Circassian frontier, was superseded.
This officer, who at the tender
age of twelve was present with
his father at the battle of Borodino,
and who has since distinguished himself
in the Turkish and Persian wars,
was reputed an able general, but was
reproached with sleeping too much,
and with being too fond of botany.
His enemies went so far as to accuse
him of making military expeditions
into the mountains, with the sole view
of adding rare Caucasian plants to his
<em>herbarium</em>, and of procuring seeds for
his garden. General Aurep, who succeeded
him, undertook little beyond
reconnoissances, always attended with
very heavy loss; and the Circassians
remained upon the defensive until the
year 1843, when the example of the
Tshetshens, who about that time
obtained signal advantages over the
Russians, roused the martial ardour
of the chivalrous Circassians, and
spurred them to fresh hostilities. But
the war at the western extremity of
Caucasus never assumed the importance
of that in Daghestan and the
country of the Tshetshens.</p>

<p>From the straits of Zabache to the
frontier of Guria, the Russians possess
seventeen <em>Kreposts</em>, or fortified posts,
only a few of which deserve the name
of regular fortresses, or could resist a
regular army provided with artillery.
To mountaineers, however, whose sole
weapons are shaska and musket, even
earthen parapets and shallow ditches
are serious obstacles when well manned
and resolutely defended. The
object of erecting this line of forts was
to cut off the communication by sea
between Turkey and the Caucasian
tribes. It was thought that, when the
import of arms and munitions of war
from Turkey was thus checked, the
independent mountain tribes would
soon be subjugated. The hope was
not realised, and the expensive maintenance
of 15,000 to 20,000 men in
the fortresses of the Black Sea has but
little improved the position of the
Russians in the Caucasus. The Caucasians
have never lacked arms, and
with money they can always get powder,
even from the Cossacks of the
Kuban. In another respect, however,
these forts have done them much
harm, and thence it arises that, since
their erection, and the cession of
Anapa to Russia, the war has assumed
so bitter a character. So long as
Anapa was Turkish, the export of
slaves, and the import of powder,
found no hindrance. The needy Circassian
noble, whose rude mountains
supply him but sparingly with daily
bread, obtained, by the sale of slaves,
means of satisfying his warlike and
ostentatious tastes&mdash;of procuring rich
clothes, costly weapons, and ammunition
for war and for the chase. In a
moral point of view, all slave traffic is
of course odious and reprehensible, but
that of Circassia differed from other
commerce of the kind, in so far that
all parties were benefited by, and
consenting to, the contract. The
Turks obtained from Caucasus handsomer
and healthier wives than those
born in the harem; and the Circassian
beauties were delighted to exchange
the poverty and toil of their father's
mountain huts for the luxurious <em>farniente</em>
of the seraglio, of whose wonders
and delights their ears were regaled,
from childhood upwards, with
the most glowing descriptions. The
trade, although greatly impeded and
very hazardous, still goes on. Small
Turkish craft creep up to the coast,
cautiously evading the Russian cruisers,
enter creeks and inlets, and are
dragged by the Circassians high and
dry upon the beach, there to remain
till the negotiation for their live cargo
is completed, an operation that generally
takes a few weeks. The women
sold are the daughters of serfs and
freedmen: rarely does a <em>work</em> consent
to dispose of his sister or daughter,
although the case does sometimes
occur. But, whilst the sale goes on,
the slave-ships are anything but secure.
It is a small matter to have escaped
the Russian frigates and steamers.
Each of the Kreposts possesses a little
squadron of row-boats, manned with
Cossacks, who pull along the coast in
search of Turkish vessels. If they
detect one, they land in the night, and
endeavour to set fire to it, before the
mountaineers can come to the assistance
of the crew. The Turks, who
live in profound terror of these Cossack
coast-guards, resort to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
possible expedient to escape their
observation; often covering their vessels
with dry leaves and boughs, and
tying fir branches to the masts, that
the scouts may take them for trees.
If they are captured at sea by the
cruisers, the crew are sent to hard
labour in Siberia, and the Circassian
girls are married to Cossacks, or
divided as handmaidens amongst the
Russian staff officers. From thirty
to forty slaves compose the usual
cargo of each of these vessels, which
are so small that the poor creatures
are packed almost like herrings in a
barrel. But they patiently endure the
misery of the voyage, in anticipation
of the honeyed existence of the harem.
It is calculated that one vessel out of
six is taken or lost. In the winter
of 1843-4, eight-and-twenty ships left
the coast of Asia Minor for that of
Caucasia. Twenty-three safely returned,
three were burned by the
Russians, and two swallowed by the
waves.</p>

<p>A Turkish captain at Sinope told
Dr Wagner the following interesting
anecdote, illustrating Circassian hatred
of the Russians:&mdash;"A few years ago
a slave-ship sprang a leak out at sea,
just as a Russian steamer passed in
the distance. The Turkish slave-dealer,
who preferred even the chill
blasts of Siberia to a grave in deep
water, made signals of distress, and the
steamer came up in time to rescue the
ship and its living cargo from destruction.
But so deeply is hatred of
Russia implanted in every Circassian
heart, that the spirit of the girls revolted
at the thought of becoming the
helpmates of gray-coated soldiers, instead
of sharing the sumptuous couch
of a Turkish pasha. They had bid
adieu to their native mountains with
little emotion, but as the Russian ship
approached they set up terrible and
despairing screams. Some sprang
headlong into the sea; others drove
their knives into their hearts:&mdash;to these
heroines death was preferable to the
bridal-bed of a detested Muscovite.
The survivors were taken to Anapa,
and married to Cossacks, or given to
officers as servants." Nearly every
Austrian or Turkish steamboat that
makes, in the winter months, the voyage
from Trebizond to Constantinople,
has a number of Circassian girls on
board. Dr Wagner made the passage
in an Austrian steamer with several
dozens of these willing slaves, chiefly
mere children, twelve or thirteen years
old, with interesting countenances and
dark wild eyes, but very pale and thin&mdash;with
the exception of two, who were
some years older, far better dressed,
and carefully veiled. To this favoured
pair the slave-dealer paid particular
attention, and frequently brought them
coffee. Dr Wagner got into conversation
with this man, who was richly
dressed in furs and silks, and who,
despite his vile profession, had the
manners of a gentleman. The two
coffee-drinkers were daughters of
noblemen, he said, with fine rosy
cheeks, and in better condition than
the others, consequently worth more
money at Constantinople. For the
handsomest he hoped to obtain 30,000
piastres, and for the other 20,000&mdash;about
£250 and £170. The herd of
young creatures he spoke of with contempt,
and should think himself lucky
to get 2000 piastres for them all round.
He further informed the doctor that,
although the slave-trade was more
dangerous and difficult since the Russian
occupation of the Caucasian coast,
it was also far more profitable. Formerly,
when Greek and Armenian
women were brought in crowds to
the Constantinople market, the most
beautiful Circassians were not worth
more than 10,000 piastres; but now
a rosy, well-fed, fifteen-year-old slave
is hardly to be had under 40,000
piastres.</p>

<p>The Tshetshen successes, already
referred to as having at the close of
1842 stirred into flame and action, by
the force of example, the smouldering
but still ardent embers of Circassian
hatred to Russia, are described with
remarkable spirit by Dr Wagner, in the
chapter entitled "Caucasian War-Scenes,"&mdash;episodes
taken down by him
from the lips of eye-witnesses, and
of sharers in the sanguinary conflicts
described. This graphic chapter at
once familiarises the reader with the
Caucasian war, with which he thenceforward
feels as well acquainted as
with our wars in India, the French
contest in Africa, or with any other
series of combats, of whose nature
and progress minute information has
been regularly received. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
event described is the storming of
Aculcho, in the summer of 1839. It
is always a great point with guerilla
generals, and with leaders of mountain
warfare, to have a centre of operations&mdash;a
strong post, whither they can
retreat after a reverse, with the confidence
that the enemy will hesitate before
attacking them there. In Spain,
Cabrera had Morella, the Count
d'Espagne had Berga, the Navarrese
viewed Estella as their citadel. In
the eastern Caucasus, Chasi-Mollah
had Himri, and preferred falling in its
defence to abandoning his stronghold;
his successor, Chamyl, who surpasses
him in talent for war and organisation,
established his headquarters at
Aculcho, a sort of eagle's nest on the
river Koisu, whither his escorts
brought him intelligence of each movement
of Russian troops, and whence
he swooped, like the bird whose eyrie
he occupied, upon the convoys traversing
the steppe of the Terek.
Here he planned expeditions and
surprises, and kept a store of arms
and ammunition; and this fort General
Grabbe, who commanded in 1839 the
Russian forces in eastern Caucasus,
and who was always a strong advocate
of the offensive system, obtained
permission from St Petersburg to
attack. General Golowin, commander-in-chief
of the whole army of
the Caucasus, and then resident at
Teflis, approved the enterprise, whose
ultimate results cost both generals
their command. The taking of
Aculcho itself was of little moment;
there was no intention of placing a
Russian garrison there; but the
double end to be obtained was to
capture Chamyl, and to intimidate
the Tshetshens, by proving to them
that no part of their mountains, however
difficult of access and bravely
defended, was beyond the reach of
Russian valour and resources. Their
submission, at least nominal and
temporary, was the result hoped for.</p>

<p>Nature has done much for the fortification
of Aculcho. Imagine a hill
of sand-stone, nearly surrounded by
a loop of the river Koisu&mdash;a miniature
peninsula, in short, connected
with the continent by a narrow neck
of land&mdash;provided with three natural
terraces, accessible only by a small
rocky path, whose entrance is fortified
and defended by 500 resolute
Tshetshen warriors. A few artificial
parapets and intrenchments, some
stone huts, and several excavations in
the sand rock, where the besieged
found shelter from shot and shell,
complete the picture of the place
before which Grabbe and his column
sat down. At first they hoped to
reduce it by artillery, and bombs and
congreve rockets were poured upon
the fortress, destroying huts and
parapets, but doing little harm to the
Tshetshens, who lay close as conies
in their burrows, and watched their
opportunity to send well-aimed bullets
into the Russian camp. From time
to time, one of the fanatical Murides,
of whom the garrison was chiefly
composed, impatient that the foe
delayed an assault, rushed headlong
down from the rock, his shaska in his
right hand, his pistol in his left, his
dagger between his teeth; causing a
momentary panic among the Cossacks,
who were prepared for the whistling
of bullets, but not for the sudden
appearance of a foaming demon armed
<i>cap-à-pie</i>, who generally, before they
could use their bayonets, avenged in
advance his own certain death by the
slaughter of several of his foes, whilst
his comrades on the rock applauded
and rejoiced at the heroic self-sacrifice.
The first attempt to storm was
costly to the besiegers. Of fifteen
hundred men who ascended the narrow
path, only a hundred and fifty
survived. The Tshetshens maintained
such a well-directed platoon fire, that
not a Russian set foot on the second
terrace. The foremost men, mown
down by the bullets of the besieged,
fell back upon their comrades, and
precipitated them from the rock.
General Grabbe, undismayed by his
heavy loss, ordered a second and a
third assault; the three cost two
thousand men, but the lower and
middle terraces were taken. The
defence of the upper one was desperate,
and the Russians might have
been compelled to turn the siege into
a blockade, but for the imprudence
of some of the garrison, who, anxious
to ascertain the proceedings of the
enemy's engineers&mdash;then hard at
work at a mine under the hill&mdash;ventured
too far from their defences, and
were attacked by a Russian battalion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
The Tshetshens fled; but, swift of foot
though they were, the most active of
the Russians attained the topmost
terrace with them. A hand-to-hand
fight ensued, more battalions came
up, and Aculcho was taken. The
victors, furious at their losses, and at
the long resistance opposed to them,
(this was the 22d August,) raged like
tigers amongst the unfortunate little
band of mountaineers; some Tshetshen
women, who took up arms at
this last extremity, were slaughtered
with their husbands. At last the
bloody work was apparently at an
end, and search ensued amongst the
dead for the body of Chamyl. It was
nowhere to be found. At last the
discovery was made that a few of the
garrison had taken refuge in holes in
the side of the rock, looking over the
river. No path led to these cavities;
the only way to get at them was to
lower men by ropes from the crag
above. In this manner the surviving
Tshetshens were attacked; quarter
was neither asked nor given. The
hole in which Chamyl himself was
hidden held out the longest. Escape
seemed, however, impossible; the
rock was surrounded; the banks of
the river were lined with soldiers;
Grabbe's main object was the capture
of Chamyl. At this critical moment
the handful of Tshetshens still alive
gave an example of heroic devotion.
They knew that their leader's death
would be a heavy loss to their country,
and they resolved to sacrifice themselves
to save him. With a few
beams and planks, that chanced to be
in the cave, they constructed a sort
of raft. This they launched upon the
Koisu, and floated with it down the
stream, amidst a storm of Russian
lead. The Russian general doubted
not that Chamyl was on the raft, and
ordered every exertion to kill or take
him. Whilst the Cossacks spurred
their horses into the river, and the
infantry hurried along the bank, following
the raft, a man sprang out of
the hole into the Koisu, swam vigorously
across the stream, landed at an
unguarded spot, and gained the
mountains unhurt. This man was
Chamyl, who alone escaped with life
from the bloody rock of Aculcho.
His deliverance passed for miraculous
amongst the enthusiastic mountaineers,
with whom his influence, from that
day forward, increased tenfold.
Grabbe was furious; Chamyl's head
was worth more than the heads
of all the garrison: three thousand
Russians had been sacrificed for the
possession of a crag not worth the
keeping.</p>

<p>After the fall of Aculcho, Chamyl's
head-quarters were at the village of
Dargo, in the mountain region south
of the Russian fort of Girselaul, and
thence he carried on the war with
great vigour, surprising fortified posts,
cutting off convoys, and sweeping the
plain with his horsemen. Generals
Grabbe and Golowin could not
agree about the mode of operations.
The former was for taking the offensive;
the latter advocated the
defensive and blockade system.
Grabbe went to St Petersburg to
plead in person for his plan, obtained
a favourable hearing, and the emperor
sent Prince Tchernicheff, the minister
at war, to visit both flanks of the
Caucasus. Before the prince reached
the left wing of the line of operations,
Grabbe resolved to surprise him with
a brilliant achievement; and on the
29th May 1842, he marched from
Girselaul with thirteen battalions, a
small escort of mounted Cossacks, and
a train of mountain artillery, to attack
Dargo. The route was through forests,
and along paths tangled with wild
flowers and creeping plants, through
which the heavy Russian infantry,
encumbered with eight days' rations
and sixty rounds of ball-cartridge,
made but slow and painful progress.
The first day's march was accomplished
without fighting; only here
and there the slender active form of a
mountaineer was descried, as he peered
between the trees at the long column
of bayonets, and vanished as soon
as he was observed. After midnight
the dance began. The troops had
eaten their rations, and were comfortably
bivouacked, when they were
assailed by a sharp fire from an invisible
foe, to which they replied in
the direction of the flashes. This
skirmishing lasted all night; few were
killed on either side, but the whole
Russian division were deprived of
sleep, and wearied for the next day's
march. At daybreak the enemy retired;
but at noon, when passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
through a forest defile, the column
was again assailed, and soon the
horses, and a few light carts accompanying
it, were insufficient to convey
the wounded. The staff urged the
general to retrace his steps, but
Grabbe was bent on welcoming
Tchernicheff with a triumphant bulletin.
Another sleepless bivouac&mdash;another
fagging day, more skirmishing.
At last, when within sight
of the fortified village of Dargo,
the loss of the column was so heavy,
and its situation so critical, that
a retreat was ordered. The daring
and fury of the Tshetshens now
knew no bounds; they assailed the
troops sabre in hand, captured baggage
and wounded, and at night
prowled round the camp, like wolves
round a dying soldier. On the 1st
June, the fight recommenced. The
valour displayed by the mountaineers
was admitted by the Russians to be
extraordinary, as was also their skill
in wielding the terrible shaska. They
made a fierce attack on the centre of
the column&mdash;cut down the artillery-men
and captured six guns. The
Russians, who throughout the whole
of this trying expedition did their
duty as good and brave soldiers, were
furious at the loss of their artillery,
and by a desperate charge retook five
pieces, the sixth being relinquished
only because its carriage was broken.
Upon the last day of the retreat,
Chamyl came up with his horsemen.
Had he been able to get these together
two days sooner, it is doubtful whether
any portion of the column would have
escaped. As it was, the Russians
lost nearly two thousand men; the
weary and dispirited survivors re-entering
Girselaul with downcast
mien. Preparations had been made
to celebrate their triumph, and, to
add to their general's mortification,
Tchernicheff was awaiting their arrival.
On the prince's return to St
Petersburg, both Grabbe and Golowin
were removed from their commands.</p>

<p>Against this same Tshetshen fortress
of Dargo, Count Woronzoff's
expedition (already referred to) was
made, in July 1845. A capital account
of the affair is given in a letter
from a Russian officer engaged, printed
in Dr Wagner's book. Dargo had
become an important place. Chamyl
had established large stores there,
and had built a mosque, to which
came pilgrims from the remotest villages
of Daghestan and Lesghistan,
partly to pray, partly to see the
dreaded chief&mdash;equally renowned as
warrior and priest&mdash;and to give him
information concerning the state of
the country, and the movements of the
Russians. Less vigorously opposed
than Grabbe, and his measures better
taken, Woronzoff reached Dargo with
moderate loss. "The village," says
the Russian officer: "was situated
on the slope of a mountain, at the
brink of a ravine, and consisted of sixty
to seventy small stone-houses, and of a
few larger buildings, where the stones
were joined with mortar, instead of being
merely superimposed, as is usually
the case in Caucasian dwellings. One
of these buildings had several irregular
towers, of some apparent antiquity.
When we approached, a thick smoke
burst from them. Chamyl had ordered
everything to be set on fire
that could not be carried away. One
must confess that, in this fierce determination
of the enemy to refuse submission&mdash;to
defend, foot by foot, the
territory of his forefathers, and to
leave to the Russians no other trophies
than ashes and smoking ruins&mdash;there
is a certain wild grandeur which
extorts admiration, even though the
hostile chief be no better than a fanatical
barbarian." This reminds us
of the words of the Circassian chief
Mansour:&mdash;"When Turkey and England
abandon us," he said, to Bell of
the 'Vixen,'&mdash;"when all our powers
of resistance are exhausted, we will
burn our houses,and our goods,
strangle our wives and our children,
and retreat to our highest rocks, there
to die, fighting to the very last man."
"The greatest difficulty," said General
Neidhardt to Dr Wagner, who
was a frequent visitor at the house of
that distinguished officer, "with which
we have to contend, is the unappeasable,
deep-rooted, ineradicable hatred
cherished by all the mountaineers
against the Russians. For this we
know no cure; every form of severity
and of kindness has been tried in turn,
with equal ill-success." Valour and
patriotism are nearly the only good
qualities the Caucasians can boast.
They are cruel, and for the most part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
faithless, especially the Tshetshens,
and Dr Wagner warns us against
crediting the exaggerated accounts
frequently given of their many virtues.
The Circassians are said to
respect their plighted word, but there
are many exceptions. General Neidhardt
told Dr Wagner an anecdote of
a Circassian, who presented himself
before the commandant of one of the
Black Sea fortresses, and offered to
communicate most important intelligence,
on condition of a certain reward.
The reward was promised.
Then said the Circassian,&mdash;"To-morrow
after sunset, your fort will be
assailed by thousands of my countrymen."
The informer was retained,
whilst Cossacks and riflemen were sent
out, and it proved that he had spoken
the truth. The enemy, finding the
garrison on their guard, retired after
a short skirmish. The Circassian received
his recompense, which he took
without a word of thanks, and left the
fortress. Without the walls, he met
an unarmed soldier; hatred of the
Russians, and thirst of blood, again
got the ascendency: he shot the soldier
dead, and scampered off to the
mountains.</p>

<p>Chamyl did not long remain indebted
to the Russians for their visit
to Dargo. His reputation of sanctity
and valour enabled him to unite under
his orders many tribes habitually hostile
to each other, and which previously
had fought each "on its own hook."
Of these tribes he formed a powerful
league; and in May 1846 he burst
into Cabardia at the head of twenty
thousand mountaineers, four thousand
of whom were horsemen. Formidable
though this force was, the venture was
one of extreme temerity. He left behind
him a double line of Russian
camps and forts, and two rivers, then
at the flood, and difficult to pass.
With an undisciplined and heterogeneous
army, without artillery or regular
commissariat, this daring chief
threw himself into a flat country, unfavourable
to guerilla warfare; slipping
through the Russian posts, marching
more than four hundred miles, and
utterly disregarding the danger he was
in from a well-equipped army of upwards
of seventy thousand men, to
say nothing of the numerous military
population of the Cossack settlements
on the Terek and Sundscha, and of the
fact that the Cabardians, long submissive
to Russia, were more likely
to arm in defence of their rulers than
to favour the mountaineers. Shepherds
and dwellers in the plain, and
far less warlike than the other Circassian
tribes, they never were able
to make head against the Russians;
and had remained indifferent to all
the incentives of Tshetshen fanatics
and propagandists. For years past,
Chamyl had threatened them with a
visit; but nevertheless, his sudden
appearance greatly surprised and confounded
both them and the Russian
general, who had just concentrated all
his movable columns, with a view to
an expedition, relying overmuch upon
his lines of forts and blockhouses.
The Tshetshen raid was more daring,
and at least as successful, as Abd-el-Kader's
celebrated foray in the Metidja,
in the year 1839. Chamyl addressed
to the Cabardians a thundering
proclamation, full of quotations from
the Koran, and denouncing vengeance
on them if they did not flock to the
banner of the Prophet. The unlucky
keepers of sheep found themselves between
the devil and the deep sea.
From terror rather than sympathy,
a large number of villages declared for
Chamyl, whose wild hordes burned
and plundered the property of all who
adhered to the Russians; leaving, like
a swarm of locusts, desolation in their
track. When the Cossacks began to
gather, and the Russian generals to
man&oelig;uvre, Chamyl, who knew he
could not contend in the plain with
disciplined and superior forces, and
whose retreat by the road he came
was already cut off, traversed Great
and Little Cabardia, burning and destroying
as he went; dashed through
the Cossack colonies to the south of
Ekaterinograd, and regained his mountains
in safety&mdash;dragging with him
booty, prisoners, and Cabardian recruits.
These latter, who had joined
through fear of Chamyl, remained
with him through fear of the Russians.
By this foray, whose apparent great
rashness was justified by its complete
success, Chamyl enriched his people,
strengthened his army, and greatly
weakened the confidence of the tribes
of the plain in the efficacy of Russian
protection. As usual, in cases of disaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the Russians kept the affair as
quiet as they could; but the truth
could not be concealed from those
most concerned, and murmurs of dismay
ran along the exposed line fringing
the Muscovite and Circassian territories.</p>

<p>The Russian army of the Caucasus
reckoned, in 1843, about eighty thousand
men, exclusive of thirty-five
thousand who had little to do with
the war, but were more especially
employed in watching the extensive
line of Turkish and Persian frontier,
and in endeavouring to exclude contraband
goods and Asiatic epidemics.
But the severe fighting that occurred
in 1842 and 1843, showed the necessity
of an increase of force. Subsequent
events have not admitted of a
reduction in the Caucasian establishment;
and we are probably very near
the mark, in estimating the troops
occupying the various forts and camps
on the Black Sea, and the lines of the
rivers, (Terek, Kuban, Koisu, &amp;c.,)
at about one hundred thousand men&mdash;not
at all too many to guard so extensive
a line, against so active and
enterprising a foe. The Russian ranks
are constantly thinned by destructive
fevers, which, in bad years, have been
known to carry off as much as a sixth
of the Caucasian army. At a review
at Vladikawkas, Dr Wagner was
struck by the powerful build of the
Russian foot-soldiers&mdash;broad-shouldered,
broad-faced Slavonians, with
enormous mustaches, drilled to automatical
perfection. In point of bone
and limb, every man of them was a
grenadier. In a bayonet charge, such
infantry are formidable opponents.
Ségur mentions that, on the battle-field
of Borodino, the nation of the
stripped bodies was easily known&mdash;the
muscle and size of the Russians
contrasting with the slighter frames of
French and Germans. "You may
kill the Russians, but you will hardly
make them run," was a saying of
Frederick the Great; and certainly
Seidlitz, who scattered the French so
briskly at Rossbach, had to sweat
blood before he overcame the Russians
at Zorndorf. Those survivors of Napoleon's
famous Guard who fought in
the drawn battle of Eylau, will bear
witness to the stubborn resistance and
bull-dog qualities of the Muscovite.
But the grenadier stature, and the immobility
under fire&mdash;admirable qualities
on a plain, and against regular
troops&mdash;avail little in the Caucasus.
The burly Russian pants and perspires
up the hills, which the light-footed chamois-like
Circassians and Tshetshens
ascend at a run. The mountaineers
understand their advantages, and decline
standing still in the plain to be
charged by a line of bayonets. They
dance round the heavy Russian, who,
with his well-stuffed knapsack and
long greatcoat, can barely turn on
his heel fast enough to face them.
They catch him out skirmishing, and
slaughter him in detail. "One might
suppose," said a foreigner in the Russian
service to Dr Wagner, "that the
musket and bayonet of the Russian
soldier would be too much, in single
combat, for the sabre and dagger of
the Tshetshen. The contrary is the
case. Amongst the dead, slain in
hand-to-hand encounter, there are
usually a third more Russians than
Caucasians. Strange to say, too, the
Russian soldier, who in the serried
ranks of his battalion meets death
with wonderful firmness, and who has
shown the utmost valour in contests
with European, Turkish, and Persian
armies, often betrays timidity in the
Caucasian war, and retreats from the
outposts to the column, in spite of the
heavy punishment he thereby incurs.
I myself was exposed, during the murderous
fight near Ischkeri (Dargo,) in
1842, to considerable danger, because,
having gone to the assistance of a
skirmisher, who was sharply engaged
with a Tshetshen, the skirmisher ran,
leaving me to fight it out alone."
This shyness of Russian soldiers in
single fight and irregular warfare, is
not inexplicable. They have no
chance of promotion, no honourable
stimulus: food and brandy, discipline
and dread of the lash, convert them
from serfs into soldiers. As bits of a
machine, they are admirable when
united, but asunder they are mere
screws and bolts. Fanatic zeal, bitter
hatred, and thirst of blood, animate
the Caucasian, who, trained to
arms from his boyhood, and ignorant
of drill, relies only upon his keen
shaska, and upon the Prophet's protection.</p>

<p>Presuming Dr Wagner's statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of Russian rations to be correct, it is
a puzzle how the soldier preserves the
condition of his thews and sinews.
The daily allowance consists of three
pounds of bread, black as a coal; a
water-soup, in which three pounds of
bacon are cut up for every two hundred
and fifty men; a ration of <em>wodka</em>,
or bad brandy, and once a-week a
small piece of meat. The pay is nine
rubles a-year, (about one-third of a
penny <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</i>,) out of which the unfortunate
private has to purchase his
stock, cap, soap, blacking, salt, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Any surplus he is allowed to expend
upon his amusement. "Our soldiers
are obliged to steal a little," said a
German officer in the Russian service
to Dr Wagner; "their pay will not
purchase soap and blacking; and if
their shirts are not clean, and their
shoes polished, the stick is their portion."
"Stealing a little," in one
way or other, is no uncommon practice
in Russia, even amongst more highly
placed personages than the soldiers.
Officials of all kinds, both civil and military,
particularly those of the middle
and lower ranks, are prone to peculation.
Dr Wagner was deafened with
the complaints that from all sides met
his ear. "Ah! if the emperor knew
it!" was the usual cry. The subjects
of Nicholas have strong faith in his
justice. It is well remembered in the
Caucasus, especially by the army,
how one day, at Teflis, the emperor,
upon parade, in full view of mob and
soldiers, tore, with his own hand, the
golden insignia of a general's rank
from the coat of Prince Dadian, denounced
to him as enriching himself
at his men's expense. For several
years afterwards, the prince carried the
musket, and wore the coarse gray coat
of a private sentinel. The officers
pitied him, although his condemnation
was just. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut profiter d'une
bonne place</i>," is their current maxim.
The soldiers rejoiced; but in secret;
for such rejoicings are not always safe.
A sentence often recoils unpleasantly
upon the accuser. Dr Wagner gives
sundry examples. A major in Sewastopol
fell in love with a sergeant's
wife; and as she disregarded his addresses,
he persecuted her and her
husband at every opportunity. In
despair, the sergeant at last complained
to the general commanding.
He was listened to; an investigation
ensued; the major was superseded;
and from his successor the sergeant
received five hundred lashes, under
pretence of his having left his regiment
without permission when he
went to lodge his charge. Corporal
punishment, of frequent application,
at the mere caprice of their superiors,
to Russian serfs and soldiers, is inflicted
with sticks or rods, the knout
being reserved for very grave offences,
such as murder, rebellion, &amp;c., and
preceding banishment to Siberia,
should the sufferer survive. Dr
Wagner's description of this dreadful
punishment is horribly vivid. Few
criminals are sentenced to more than
twenty-five lashes, and less than
twenty often kill. Running the gauntlet
through three thousand men is the
usual punishment of deserters; and
this would usually be a sentence of
death but for the compassion of the
officers, who hint to their companies
to strike lightly. If the sufferer
faints, and is declared by the surgeon
unable to receive all his punishment,
he gets the remainder at some future
time. "Take him down" is a phrase
unknown in the Russian service, until
the offender has received the last lash
of his sentence.</p>

<p>Severity is doubtless necessary in
an army composed like that of Russia.
Two-thirds of the soldiers are serfs,
whose masters, being allowed to send
what men they please&mdash;so long as
they make up their quota&mdash;naturally
contribute the greatest scamps and
idlers upon their estates. The army
in Russia is what the galleys are in
France, and the hulks in England&mdash;a
punishment for an infinity of offences.
An official embezzles funds&mdash;to the
army with him; a Jew is caught
smuggling&mdash;off with him to the ranks;
a Tartar cattle-stealer, a vagrant
gipsy, an Armenian trader convicted
of fraud, a Petersburg coachman who
has run over a pedestrian&mdash;all food
for powder&mdash;gray coats and bayonets
for them all. Jews abound in the
Russian army, being subjected to a
severe conscription in Poland and
southern Russia. They submit with
exemplary patience to the hardships
of the service, and to the taunts of
their Russian comrades. Poles are of
course numerous in the ranks, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
they are less enduring than the Israelite,
and often desert to the Circassians,
who make them work as servants, or
sell them as slaves to the Turks. No
race are too unmilitary in their nature
to be ground into soldiers by the mill
of Russian discipline. Besides Jews,
gipsies and Armenians figure on the
muster-roll. It must have been a
queer day for the ragged Zingaro,
when the Russian sergeant first stepped
into his smoky tent, bade him
clip his elf locks, wash his grimy
countenance, and follow to the field.
For him the pomp of war had no
seductions; he would far rather have
stuck to his den and vermin, and to
his meal of roast rats and hedgehogs.
But military discipline works miracles.
The slouching filthy vagabond of yesterday
now stands erect as if he had
swallowed his ramrod, his shoes a
brilliant jet, his buttons sparkling in
the sun&mdash;a soldier from toe to top-knot.</p>

<p>The right bank of the Kuban, from
the Sea of Azov to the mouth of the
Laba, (a tributary of the former
stream,) is peopled with Tchernamortsy
Cossacks, who furnish ten
regiments, each of a thousand horsemen,
for the defence of their lands
and families. These cavalry carry a
musket, slung on the back, and a long
red lance: their dress is a sheepskin
jacket, except on state occasions, when
they sport uniform. They are much
less feared by the Circassians than
are the Cossacks of the Line, who
wear the Circassian dress, carry sabres
instead of lances, and are more valiant,
active and skilful, than their
Tchernamortsy neighbours. The Cossacks
of the Caucasian Line dwell on
the banks of the Kuban and Terek,
form a military colony of about fifty
thousand souls, and keep six thousand
horsemen ready for the field. There
is a mixture of Circassian blood in
their veins, and they are first-rate
fighting men. Their villages are exposed
to frequent attacks from the
mountaineers; but when these are not
exceedingly rapid in collecting their
booty, and effecting their retreat, the
Cossacks assemble, and a desperate
fight ensues. When the combatants
are numerically matched, the equality
of arms, horses, and skill renders the
issue very doubtful. The Tchernamortsies
and Don Cossacks are less
able to cope with the Circassians. In
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> their lances are inferior to the
shaska. The rival claims of lance
and sabre have often been discussed;
many trials of their respective merits
have been made in English, French,
and German riding-schools; and much
ink has been shed on the subject.
Unquestionably the lance has done
good service, and in certain circumstances
is a terrible arm. "At the
battle of Dresden," Marshal Marmont
tells us, "the Austrian infantry were
repeatedly assailed by the French
cuirassiers, whom they as often beat
back, although the rain prevented
their firing, and the bayonet was their
sole defence. But fifty lancers of
Latour-Maubourg's escort at once
broke their ranks." Had the cuirassiers
had lances, their first charge,
Marmont plausibly enough asserts,
would have sufficed. This leads to
another question, often mooted&mdash;whether
the lance be properly a light
or a heavy cavalry weapon. When
used to break infantry, weight of man
and horse might be an advantage;
but in pursuit, where&mdash;especially in
rugged and mountainous countries&mdash;the
lance is found particularly useful,
the preference is obviously for the
swift steed and light cavalier. In the
irregular cavalry combats on the Caucasian
line, the sabre carries the day.
Unless the Don Cossack's first lance-thrust
settles his adversary, (which is
rarely the case,) the next instant the
adroit Circassian is within his guard,
and then the betting is ten to one on
Caucasus. Moreover, the Don Cossacks,
brought from afar to wage a
perilous and profitless war, are unwilling
combatants. They find blows
more plentiful than booty, and approve
themselves arrant thieves and shy
fighters. Relieved every two or three
years, they have scarcely time to get
broken in to the peculiar mode of
warfare. The Cossacks of the Line
are the flower of the hundred thousand
wild warriors scattered over
the steppes of Southern Russia, and
ready, at one man's word, to vault
into the saddle. Their gallant feats
are numerous. In 1843, during Dr
Wagner's visit, three thousand Circassians
dashed across the Kuban,
near the fortified village of Ustlaba.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
A dense fog hid them from the Russian
vedettes. Suddenly fifty Cossacks
of the Line, the escort of a gun,
found themselves face to face with the
mountaineers. The mist was so thick
that the horses' heads almost touched
before either party perceived the other.
Flight was impossible, but the Cossacks
fought like fiends. Forty-seven
met a soldier's death; only three were
captured, and accompanied the cannon
across the river, by which road
the Circassians at once retreated,
having taken the brave detachment
for the advanced guard of a strong
force.</p>

<p>The word Kasak, Kosak, or Kossack,
variously interpreted by Klaproth and
other etymologists as robber, volunteer,
daredevil, &amp;c., conveys to civilised
ears rude and inelegant associations.
Paris has not yet forgotten
the uncouth hordes, wrapped in sheepskins
and overrun with vermin, who,
in the hour of her humiliation, startled
her streets, and made her dandies
shriek for their smelling-bottles. Not
that Paris saw the worst of them.
Some of the Uralian bears, centaurs of
the steppes, Calibans on horseback,
were never allowed to pass the Russian
frontier. Their emperor appreciated
their good qualities, but left them at
home. Since then, a change has occured.
Civilisation has made huge strides
north-eastward. Near Fanagoria, Dr
Wagner passed a pleasant evening
with a Cossack officer, a prime fellow,
with all unquenchable thirst for toddy,
and an inexhaustible store of information.
He had made the campaigns
against the French; had evidently
been bred a savage, or little better;
but had acquired, during his long military
career, knowledge of the world and
a certain degree of polish. Amongst
other interesting matters, he gave a
sketch of his grandfather, a bloodthirsty
old warrior and image-worshipper,
the scourge of his Nogay
neighbours, and a great slayer of the
Turk; who in 1812, at the mature age
of ninety, had responded to Czar
Alexander's summons to fight for
"faith and fatherland," and had
taken the field under Platoff, at
the head of thirteen sons and threescore
grandsons. Whilst the Cossack
major told the history of the "Demon
of the Steppes," as his ferocious
ancestor was called, his son, a gay
lieutenant in the Cossacks of the Guard,
entered the apartment. This young
gentleman, slender, handsome, with
well-cut uniform, graceful manners,
and well-waxed mustaches, declined
the punch, "having got used at St
Petersburg to tea and champagne."
He brought intelligence of promotions
and decorations, of high play at Tcherkask,
(the capital of the Don-Cossacks'
country,) and of the establishment
at Toganrog of a French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restaurateur</i>,
who retailed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Veuve Clicquot's</i>
genuine champagne at four silver
rubles a bottle. He was fascinated
by the French actresses at St Petersburg,
and enthusiastic in praise of
Taglioni, then displaying her legs and
graces in the Russian metropolis. Dr
Wagner left the symposium with a
vivid impression of the contrast between
the bearded barbarian of 1812
and the dapper guardsman of thirty
years later; and with the full conviction
that the next Russian emperor
who makes an inroad into civilised
Europe, will have no occasion to be
ashamed of his Cossacks, even though
his route should lead him to the polite
capital of the French republic.</p>

<h2>THE CAXTONS.&mdash;PART X.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER XLVI.</h3>

<p>My uncle's conjecture as to the
parentage of Francis Vivian seemed
to me a positive discovery. Nothing
more likely than that this wilful boy
had formed some headstrong attachment
which no father would sanction,
and so, thwarted and irritated, thrown
himself on the world. Such an explanation
was the more agreeable to me,
as it cleared up all that had appeared
more discreditable in the mystery that
surrounded Vivian. I could never
bear to think that he had done anything
mean and criminal, however I
might believe he had been rash and
faulty. It was natural that the unfriended
wanderer should have been
thrown into a society, the equivocal
character of which had failed to revolt
the audacity of an inquisitive mind
and adventurous temper; but it
was natural, also, that the habits
of gentle birth, and that silent education
which English gentlemen commonly
receive from their very cradle,
should have preserved his honour, at
least, intact through all. Certainly
the pride, the notions, the very faults
of the wellborn had remained in full
force&mdash;why not the better qualities,
however smothered for the time? I felt
thankful for the thought that Vivian
was returning to an element in which he
might repurify his mind,&mdash;refit himself
for that sphere to which he belonged;&mdash;thankful
that we might yet
meet, and our present half intimacy
mature, perhaps, into healthful friendship.</p>

<p>It was with such thoughts that I
took up my hat the next morning to
seek Vivian, and judge if we had
gained the right clue, when we were
startled by what was a rare sound at
our door&mdash;the postman's knock. My
father was at the Museum; my mother
in high conference, or close preparation
for our approaching departure, with Mrs
Primmins; Roland, I, and Blanche
had the room to ourselves.</p>

<p>"The letter is not for me," said
Pisistratus.</p>

<p>"Nor for me, I am sure," said the
Captain, when the servant entered
and confuted him&mdash;for the letter was
for him. He took it up wonderingly
and suspiciously, as Glumdalclitch
took up Gulliver, or as (if naturalists)
we take up an unknown creature, that
we are not quite sure will not bite and
sting us. Ah! it has stung or bit you,
Captain Roland! for you start and
change colour&mdash;you suppress a cry as
you break the seal&mdash;you breathe hard
as you read&mdash;and the letter seems
short&mdash;but it takes time in the reading,
for you go over it again and again.
Then you fold it up&mdash;crumple it&mdash;thrust
it into your breast pocket&mdash;and
look round like a man waking from
a dream. Is it a dream of pain, or of
pleasure? Verily, I cannot guess, for
nothing is on that eagle face either of
pain or pleasure, but rather of fear,
agitation, bewilderment. Yet the eyes
are bright, too, and there is a smile on
that iron lip.</p>

<p>My uncle looked round, I say, and
called hastily for his cane and his
hat, and then began buttoning his coat
across his broad breast, though the
day was hot enough to have unbuttoned
every breast in the tropics.</p>

<p>"You are not going out, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"But are you strong enough yet?
Let me go with you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; no. Blanche, come here."
He took the child in his arms, surveyed
her wistfully, and kissed her.
"You have never given me pain,
Blanche: say, 'God bless and prosper
you, father!'"</p>

<p>"God bless and prosper my dear,
dear papa!" said Blanche, putting
her little hands together, as if in prayer.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that should bring me luck,
Blanche," said the Captain, gaily, and
setting her down. Then seizing his
cane from the servant, and putting on
his hat with a determined air, he
walked stoutly forth; and I saw him,
from the window, march along the
streets as cheerfully as if he had been
besieging Badajoz.</p>

<p>"God prosper thee, too!" said I,
involuntarily.</p>

<p>And Blanche took hold of my hand,
and said in her prettiest way, (and her
pretty ways were many), "I wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
would come with us, cousin Sisty, and
help me to love papa. Poor papa! he
wants us both&mdash;he wants all the love
we can give him!"</p>

<p>"That he does, my dear Blanche;
and I think it a great mistake that we
don't all live together. Your papa
ought not to go to that tower of his, at
the world's end, but come to our
snug, pretty house, with a garden full
of flowers, for you to be Queen of the
May&mdash;from May to November;&mdash;to
say nothing of a duck that is more
sagacious than any creature in the
Fables I gave you the other day."</p>

<p>Blanche laughed and clapped her
hands&mdash;"Oh, that would be so nice!
but,"&mdash;and she stopped gravely, and
added, "but then, you see, there would
not be the tower to love papa; and I
am sure that the tower must love him
very much, for he loves it dearly."</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh now. "I
see how it is, you little witch," said I;
"you would coax us to come and
live with you and the owls! With all
my heart, so far as I am concerned."</p>

<p>"Sisty," said Blanche, with an
appalling solemnity on her face, "do
you know what I've been thinking?"</p>

<p>"Not I, miss&mdash;what?&mdash;something
very deep, I can see&mdash;very horrible,
indeed, I fear, you look so serious."</p>

<p>"Why, I've been thinking," continued
Blanche, not relaxing a muscle,
and without the least bit of a blush&mdash;"I've
been thinking that I'll be your
little wife; and then, of course, we
shall all live together."</p>

<p>Blanche did not blush, but I did.
"Ask me that ten years hence, if you
dare, you impudent little thing; and
now, run away to Mrs Primmins, and
tell her to keep you out of mischief, for
I must say good-morning."</p>

<p>But Blanche did not run away, and
her dignity seemed exceedingly hurt
at my mode of taking her alarming
proposition, for she retired into a corner
pouting, and sate down with great
majesty. So there I left her, and
went my way to Vivian. He was out;
but, seeing books on his table, and
having nothing to do, I resolved to
wait for his return. I had enough of
my father in me to turn at once to the
books for company; and, by the side of
some graver works which I had recommended,
I found certain novels in
French, that Vivian had got from a
circulating library. I had a curiosity
to read these&mdash;for, except the old classic
novels of France, this mighty branch
of its popular literature was then
new to me. I soon got interested, but
what an interest!&mdash;the interest that a
nightmare might excite, if one caught
it out of one's sleep, and set to work
to examine it. By the side of what
dazzling shrewdness, what deep knowledge
of those holes and corners in
the human system, of which Goethe
must have spoken when he said somewhere&mdash;(if
I recollect right, and don't
misquote him, which I'll not answer
for)&mdash;"There is something in every
man's heart which, if we could know,
would make us hate him,"&mdash;by the
side of all this, and of much more that
showed prodigious boldness and energy
of intellect, what strange exaggeration&mdash;what
mock nobility of sentiment&mdash;what
inconceivable perversion of
reasoning&mdash;what damnable demoralisation!
I hate the cant of charging
works of fiction with the accusation&mdash;often
unjust and shallow&mdash;that they
interest us in vice, or palliate crime,
because the author truly shows what
virtues may entangle themselves with
vices; or commands our compassion,
and awes our pride, by teaching us
how men deceive and bewitch themselves
into guilt. Such painting belongs
to the dark truth of all tragedy,
from Sophocles to Shakspeare. No;
this is not what shocked me in those
books&mdash;it was not the interesting me in
vice, for I felt no interest in it at all; it
was the insisting that vice is something
uncommonly noble&mdash;it was the portrait
of some coldblooded adultress, whom
the author or authoress chooses to call
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre Ange!</i> (poor angel!);&mdash;it was
some scoundrel who dupes, cheats,
and murders under cover of a duel,
in which he is a second St George; who
does not instruct us by showing through
what metaphysical process he became
a scoundrel, but who is continually
forced upon us as a very favourable
specimen of mankind;&mdash;it was the view
of society altogether, painted in colours
so hideous that, if true, instead of
a revolution, it would draw down
a deluge;&mdash;it was the hatred, carefully
instilled, of the poor against the
rich&mdash;it was the war breathed between
class and class&mdash;it was that envy of all
superiorities, which loves to show itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
by allowing virtue only to a blouse, and
asserting that a man must be a rogue if
he belong to that rank of society in
which, from the very gifts of education,
from the necessary associations
of circumstances, roguery is
the last thing probable or natural. It
was all this, and things a thousand
times worse, that set my head in a whirl,
as hour after hour slipped on, and I
still gazed, spell-bound, on these Chimeras
and Typhons&mdash;these symbols
of the Destroying Principle. "Poor
Vivian!" said I, as I rose at last,
"if thou readest these books with
pleasure, or from habit, no wonder that
thou seemest to me so obtuse about
right and wrong, and to have a great
cavity where thy brain should have
the bump of 'conscientiousness' in
full salience!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to do those demoniacs
justice, I had got through time imperceptibly
by their pestilent help;
and I was startled to see, by my watch,
how late it was. I had just resolved to
leave a line, fixing an appointment for
the morrow, and so depart, when I
heard Vivian's knock&mdash;a knock that
had great character in it&mdash;haughty,
impatient, irregular; not a neat, symmetrical,
harmonious, unpretending
knock, but a knock that seemed to
set the whole house and street at defiance:
it was a knock bullying&mdash;a
knock ostentatious&mdash;a knock irritating
and offensive&mdash;"impiger" and
"iracundus."</p>

<p>But the step that came up the stairs
did not suit the knock: it was a step
light, yet firm&mdash;slow, yet elastic.</p>

<p>The maid-servant who had opened
the door had, no doubt, informed
Vivian of my visit, for he did not seem
surprised to see me; but he cast that
hurried, suspicious look round the
room which a man is apt to cast
when he has left his papers about, and
finds some idler, on whose trustworthiness
he by no means depends, seated
in the midst of the unguarded secrets.
The look was not flattering; but my
conscience was so unreproachful that
I laid all the blame upon the general
suspiciousness of Vivian's character.</p>

<p>"Three hours, at least, have I been
here!" said I, maliciously.</p>

<p>"Three hours!"&mdash;again the look.</p>

<p>"And this is the worst secret I have
discovered,"&mdash;and I pointed to those
literary Manicheans.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said he carelessly, "French
novels!&mdash;I don't wonder you stayed so
long. I can't read your English
novels&mdash;flat and insipid: there are
truth and life here."</p>

<p>"Truth and life!" cried I, every
hair on my head erect with astonishment&mdash;"then
hurrah for falsehood and
death!"</p>

<p>"They don't please you; no accounting
for tastes."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon&mdash;I account for
yours, if you really take for truth and
life monsters so nefast and flagitious.
For heaven's sake, my dear fellow,
don't suppose that any man could get
on in England&mdash;get anywhere but to
the Old Bailey or Norfolk Island, if
he squared his conduct to such topsy-turvy
notions of the world as I find
here."</p>

<p>"How many years are you my
senior," asked Vivian sneeringly,
"that you should play the mentor,
and correct my ignorance of the
world?"</p>

<p>"Vivian, it is not age and experience
that speak here, it is something
far wiser than they&mdash;the instinct of
a man's heart, and a gentleman's
honour."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Vivian, rather
discomposed, "let the poor books
alone; you know my creed&mdash;that books
influence us little one way or the
other."</p>

<p>"By the great Egyptian library,
and the soul of Diodorus, I wish you
could hear my father upon that point!
Come," added I, with sublime compassion&mdash;"come,
it is not too late&mdash;do
let me introduce you to my father.
I will consent to read French
novels all my life, if a single chat with
Austin Caxton does not send you
home with a happier face and a lighter
heart. Come, let me take you back
to dine with us to-day."</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Vivian with some
confusion&mdash;"I cannot, for this day I
leave London. Some other time perhaps&mdash;for,"
he added, but not heartily,
"we may meet again."</p>

<p>"I hope so," said I, wringing his
hand, "and that is likely,&mdash;since, in
spite of yourself, I have guessed your
secret&mdash;your birth and parentage."</p>

<p>"How!" cried Vivian, turning pale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and gnawing his lip&mdash;"what do you
mean?&mdash;speak."</p>

<p>"Well, then, are you not the lost,
runaway son of Colonel Vivian?
Come, say the truth; let us be confidants."</p>

<p>Vivian threw off a succession of his
abrupt sighs; and then, seating himself,
leant his face on the table, confused,
no doubt, to find himself discovered.</p>

<p>"You are near the mark," said he
at last, "but do not ask me farther
yet. Some day," he cried impetuously,
and springing suddenly to his
feet&mdash;"some day you shall know all:
yes; some day, if I live, when that
name shall be high in the world; yes,
when the world is at my feet!" He
stretched his right hand as if to grasp the
space, and his whole face was lighted
with a fierce enthusiasm. The glow
died away, and with a slight return of
his scornful smile, he said&mdash;"Dreams
yet; dreams! And now, look at this
paper." And he drew out a memorandum,
scrawled over with figures.</p>

<p>"This, I think, is my pecuniary
debt to you; in a few days, I shall
discharge it. Give me your address."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, pained, "can you
speak to me of money, Vivian?"</p>

<p>"It is one of those instincts of
honour you cite so often," answered
he, colouring. "Pardon me."</p>

<p>"That is my address," said I,
stooping to write, to conceal my
wounded feelings. "You will avail
yourself of it, I hope, often, and tell
me that you are well and happy."</p>

<p>"When I am happy, you shall
know."</p>

<p>"You do not require any introduction
to Trevanion?"</p>

<p>Vivian hesitated: "No, I think not.
If ever I do, I will write for it."</p>

<p>I took up my hat, and was about to
go&mdash;for I was still chilled and mortified&mdash;when,
as if by an irresistible impulse,
Vivian came to me hastily,
flung his arms round my neck, and
kissed me as a boy kisses his brother.</p>

<p>"Bear with me!" he cried in a
faltering voice: "I did not think to
love any one as you have made me
love you, though sadly against the
grain. If you are not my good angel,
it is that nature and habit are too
strong for you. Certainly, some day
we shall meet again. I shall have
time, in the meanwhile, to see if the
world can be indeed 'mine oyster,
which I with sword can open.' I
would be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aut Cæsar aut nullus</i>! Very
little other Latin know I to quote
from! If Cæsar, men will forgive me
all the means to the end; if <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullus</i>,
London has a river, and in every
street one may buy a cord!"</p>

<p>"Vivian! Vivian!"</p>

<p>"Now go, my dear friend, while
my heart is softened&mdash;go, before I
shock you with some return of the
native Adam. Go&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>And taking me gently by the arm,
Francis Vivian drew me from the
room, and, re-entering, locked his
door.</p>

<p>Ah! if I could have left him Robert
Hall, instead of those execrable Typhons!
But would that medicine have
suited his case, or must grim Experience
write sterner recipes with her
iron hand?</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XLVII.</h3>

<p>When I got back, just in time for
dinner, Roland had not returned, nor
did he return till late in the evening.
All our eyes were directed towards
him, as we rose with one accord to
give him welcome; but his face was
like a mask&mdash;it was locked, and rigid,
and unreadable.</p>

<p>Shutting the door carefully after him,
he came to the hearth, stood on it,
upright and calm, for a few moments,
and then asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Has Blanche gone to bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said my mother, "but not
to sleep, I am sure; she made me
promise to tell her when you came
back."</p>

<p>Roland's brow relaxed.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, sister," said he slowly,
"will you see that she has the proper
mourning made for her? My son is
dead."</p>

<p>"Dead!" we cried with one voice,
and surrounding him with one impulse.</p>

<p>"Dead! impossible&mdash;you could not
say it so calmly. Dead!&mdash;how do
you know? You may be deceived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Who told you?&mdash;why do you think
so?"</p>

<p>"I have seen his remains," said
my uncle, with the same gloomy
calm. "We will all mourn for him.
Pisistratus, you are heir to my name
now, as to your father's. Good-night;
excuse me, all&mdash;all you dear
and kind ones; I am worn out."</p>

<p>Roland lighted his candle and went
away, leaving us thunderstruck; but
he came back again&mdash;looked round&mdash;took
up his book, open in the favourite
passage&mdash;nodded again, and
again vanished. We looked at each
other, as if we had seen a ghost. Then
my father rose and went out of the
room, and remained in Roland's till
the night was wellnigh gone. We
sat up&mdash;my mother and I&mdash;till he returned.
His benign face looked profoundly
sad.</p>

<p>"How is it, sir Can you tell us
more?"</p>

<p>My father shook his head.</p>

<p>"Roland prays that you may preserve
the same forbearance you have
shown hitherto, and never mention his
son's name to him. Peace be to the
living, as to the dead. Kitty, this
changes our plans; we must all go
to Cumberland&mdash;we cannot leave Roland
thus!"</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Roland!" said my
mother, through her tears. "And to
think that father and son were not
reconciled. But Roland forgives him
now&mdash;oh, yes! <em>now!</em>"</p>

<p>"It is not Roland we can censure,"
said my father, almost fiercely; "it
is&mdash;but enough. We must hurry out
of town as soon as we can: Roland
will recover in the native air of his
old ruins."</p>

<p>We went up to bed mournfully.</p>

<p>"And so," thought I, "ends one
grand object of my life!&mdash;I had hoped
to have brought those two together.
But, alas! what peacemaker like the
grave!"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h3>

<p>My uncle did not leave his room for
three days, but he was much closeted
with a lawyer; and my father dropped
some words which seemed to imply that
the deceased had incurred debts, and
that the poor Captain was making
some charge on his small property.
As Roland had said that he had seen
the remains of his son, I took it at
first for granted that we should attend
a funeral, but no word of this was
said. On the fourth day, Roland, in
deep mourning, entered a hackney
coach with the lawyer, and was absent
about two hours. I did not doubt
that he had thus quietly fulfilled the
last mournful offices. On his return,
he shut himself up again for the rest
of the day, and would not see even
my father. But the next morning he
made his appearance as usual, and I
even thought that he seemed more
cheerful than I had yet known him&mdash;whether
he played a part, or whether
the worst was now over, and the
grave was less cruel than uncertainty.
On the following day, we all set out
for Cumberland.</p>

<p>In the interval, Uncle Jack had
been almost constantly at the house,
and, to do him justice, he had seemed
unaffectedly shocked at the calamity
that had befallen Roland. There was,
indeed, no want of heart in Uncle
Jack, whenever you went straight at
it; but it was hard to find if you took
a circuitous route towards it through
the pockets. The worthy speculator
had indeed much business to transact
with my father before we left town.
The <em>Anti-Publisher Society</em> had been
set up, and it was through the obstetric
aid of that fraternity that the
Great Book was to be ushered into
the world. The new journal, the <cite>Literary
Times</cite>, was also far advanced&mdash;not
yet out, but my father was fairly
in for it. There were preparations
for its debut on a vast scale, and
two or three gentlemen in black&mdash;one
of whom looked like a lawyer, and
another like a printer, and a third
uncommonly like a Jew&mdash;called twice,
with papers of a very formidable
aspect. All these preliminaries settled,
the last thing I heard Uncle Jack say,
with a slap on my father's back, was,
"Fame and fortune both made now!&mdash;you
may go to sleep in safety, for
you leave me wide awake. Jack Tibbets
never sleeps!"</p>

<p>I had thought it strange that, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
my abrupt exodus from Trevanion's
house, no notice had been taken of
any of us by himself or Lady Ellinor.
But on the very eve of our departure,
came a kind note from Trevanion to
me, dated from his favourite country
seat, (accompanied by a present of
some rare books to my father,) in
which he said briefly that there had
been illness in his family, which had
obliged him to leave town for a change
of air, but that Lady Ellinor expected
to call on my mother the next week.
He had found amongst his books some
curious works of the Middle Ages,
amongst others a complete set of
Cardan, which he knew my father
would like to have, and so sent them.
There was no allusion to what had
passed between us.</p>

<p>In reply to this note, after due
thanks on my father's part, who seized
upon the Cardan (Lyons edition,
1663, ten volumes folio) as a silkworm
does upon a mulberry leaf, I expressed
our joint regrets that there was
no hope of our seeing Lady Ellinor,
as we were just leaving town. I
should have added something on the
loss my uncle had sustained, but my
father thought that, since Roland
shrank from any mention of his
son, even by his nearest kindred, it
would be his obvious wish not to
parade his affliction beyond that circle.</p>

<p>And there had been illness in Trevanion's
family! On whom had it
fallen? I could not rest satisfied with
that general expression, and I took my
answer myself to Trevanion's house,
instead of sending it by the post. In
reply to my inquiries, the porter said
that all the family were expected at
the end of the week; that he had
heard both Lady Ellinor and Miss
Trevanion had been rather poorly, but
that they were now better. I left my
note, with orders to forward it; and
my wounds bled afresh as I came
away.</p>

<p>We had the whole coach to ourselves
in our journey, and a silent journey
it was, till we arrived at a little town
about eight miles from my uncle's residence,
to which we could only get
through a cross-road. My uncle insisted
on preceding us that night, and,
though he had written, before we started,
to announce our coming, he was fidgety
lest the poor tower should not make
the best figure it could;&mdash;so he went
alone, and we took our ease at our
inn.</p>

<p>Betimes the next day we hired a
fly-coach&mdash;for a chaise could never
have held us and my father's books&mdash;and
jogged through a labyrinth of villanous
lanes, which no Marshal Wade
had ever reformed from their primal
chaos. But poor Mrs Primmins and
the canary-bird alone seemed sensible
of the jolts; the former, who sate opposite
to us, wedged amidst a medley
of packages, all marked "care, to be
kept top uppermost," (why I know
not, for they were but books, and
whether they lay top or bottom it
could not materially affect their value,)&mdash;the
former, I say, contrived to extend
her arms over those <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</i>,
and, griping a window-sill with the
right hand, and a window-sill with the
left, kept her seat rampant, like the
split eagle of the Austrian Empire&mdash;in
fact it would be well, now-a-days,
if the split eagle were as firm as Mrs
Primmins! As for the canary, it never
failed to respond, by an astonished
chirp, to every "Gracious me!" and
"Lord save us!" which the delve
into a rut, or the bump out of it, sent
forth from Mrs Primmins's lips, with
all the emphatic dolor of thἂe "Ἂῖ, ἂῖ" in a Greek chorus.</p>

<p>But my father, with his broad hat
over his brows, was in deep thought.
The scenes of his youth were rising
before him, and his memory went,
smooth as a spirit's wing, over delve
and bump. And my mother, who
sat next him, had her arm on his
shoulder, and was watching his face
jealously. Did she think that, in that
thoughtful face, there was regret for
the old love? Blanche, who had been
very sad, and had wept much and
quietly since they put on her the
mourning, and told her that she had
no brother, (though she had no remembrance
of the lost), began now to
evince infantine curiosity and eagerness
to catch the first peep of her
father's beloved tower. And Blanche
sat on my knee, and I shared her impatience.
At last there came in view
a church spire&mdash;a church&mdash;a plain
square building near it, the parsonage,
(my father's old home)&mdash;a long
straggling street of cottages and rude
shops, with a better kind of house here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and there&mdash;and in the hinder ground,
a gray deformed mass of wall and
ruin, placed on one of those eminences
on which the Danes loved to pitch
camp or build fort, with one high,
rude, Anglo-Norman tower rising
from the midst. Few trees were
round it, and those either poplars or
firs, save, as we approached, one
mighty oak&mdash;integral and unscathed.
The road now wound behind the parsonage,
and up a steep ascent. Such a
road!&mdash;the whole parish ought to have
been flogged for it! If I had sent up
a road like that, even on a map, to Dr
Herman, I should not have sat down
in comfort for a week to come!</p>

<p>The fly-coach came to a full stop.</p>

<p>"Let us get out," cried I, opening
the door and springing to the ground
to set the example.</p>

<p>Blanche followed, and my respected
parents came next. But when Mrs
Primmins was about to heave herself
into movement,</p>

<p>"<em>Papæ!</em>" said my father. "I think,
Mrs Primmins, you must remain in, to
keep the books steady."</p>

<p>"Lord love you!" cried Mrs Primmins,
aghast.</p>

<p>"The subtraction of such a mass, or
<em>moles</em>&mdash;supple and elastic as all flesh
is, and fitting into the hard corners of
the inert matter&mdash;such a subtraction,
Mrs Primmins, would leave a vacuum
which no natural system, certainly no
artificial organisation, could sustain.
There would be a regular dance of
atoms, Mrs Primmins; my books
would fly here, there, on the floor, out
of the window!</p>

<p class="center">
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corporis officium est quoniam omnia deorsum.</i>"
</p>

<p class="noind">The business of a body like yours, Mrs
Primmins, is to press all things down&mdash;to
keep them tight, as you will know
one of these days&mdash;that is, if you will
do me the favour to read Lucretius,
and master that material philosophy,
of which I may say, without flattery,
my dear Mrs Primmins, that you are
a living illustration."</p>

<p>These, the first words my father
had spoken since we set out from the
inn, seemed to assure my mother that
she need have no apprehension as to
the character of his thoughts, for her
brow cleared, and she said, laughing,</p>

<p>"Only look at poor Primmins, and
then at that hill!"</p>

<p>"You may subtract Primmins, if
you will be answerable for the remnant,
Kitty. Only, I warn you that
it is against all the laws of physics."</p>

<p>So saying, he sprang lightly forward,
and, taking hold of my arm,
paused and looked round, and drew
the loud free breath with which we
draw native air.</p>

<p>"And yet," said my father, after
that grateful and affectionate inspiration&mdash;"and
yet, it must be owned,
that a more ugly country one cannot
see out of Cambridgeshire."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Nay," said I, "it is bold and large,
it has a beauty of its own. Those immense,
undulating, uncultivated, treeless
tracks have surely their charm of
wildness and solitude! And how they
suit the character of the ruin! All
is feudal there: I understand Roland
better now."</p>

<p>"I hope in heaven Cardan will
come to no harm!" cried my father;
"he is very handsomely bound;
and he fitted beautifully just into the
fleshiest part of that fidgety Primmins."</p>

<p>Blanche, meanwhile, had run far
before us, and I followed fast. There
were still the remains of that deep
trench (surrounding the ruins on three
sides, leaving a ragged hill-top at the
fourth) which made the favourite fortification
of all the Teutonic tribes. A
causeway, raised on brick arches, now,
however, supplied the place of the
drawbridge, and the outer gate was
but a mass of picturesque ruin. Entering
into the courtyard or bailey, the old
castle mound, from which justice had
been dispensed, was in full view, rising
higher than the broken walls
around it, and partially overgrown
with brambles. And there stood,
comparatively whole, the tower or
keep, and from its portals emerged
the veteran owner.</p>

<p>His ancestors might have received us
in more state, but certainly they could
not have given us a warmer greeting.
In fact, in his own domain, Roland
appeared another man. His stiffness,
which was a little repulsive to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
who did not understand it, was all
gone. He seemed less proud, precisely
because he and his pride, on
that ground, were on good terms with
each other. How gallantly he extended&mdash;not
his arm, in our modern
Jack-and-Jill sort of fashion&mdash;but
his right hand, to my mother; how
carefully he led her over "brake,
bush, and scaur," through the low
vaulted door, where a tall servant,
who, it was easy to see, had been a
soldier&mdash;in the precise livery, no doubt,
warranted by the heraldic colours,
(his stockings were red!)&mdash;stood upright
as a sentry. And, coming into
the hall, it looked absolutely cheerful&mdash;it
took us by surprise. There was
a great fire-place, and, though it was
still summer, a great fire! It did not
seem a bit too much, for the walls
were stone, the lofty roof open to the
rafters, while the windows were small
and narrow, and so high and so deep
sunk that one seemed in a vault.
Nevertheless, I say the room looked
sociable and cheerful&mdash;thanks principally
to the fire, and partly to a
very ingenious medley of old tapestry
at one end, and matting at the other,
fastened to the lower part of the walls,
seconded by an arrangement of furniture
which did credit to my uncle's
taste for the Picturesque. After we
had looked about and admired to our
hearts' content, Roland took us&mdash;not
up one of those noble staircases you
see in the later manorial residences&mdash;but
a little winding stone stair, into
the rooms he had appropriated to his
guests. There was first a small chamber,
which he called my father's study&mdash;in
truth, it would have done for any
philosopher or saint who wished to
shut out the world&mdash;and might have
passed for the interior of such a column
as Stylites inhabited; for you
must have climbed a ladder to have
looked out of the window, and then
the vision of no short-sighted man
could have got over the interval in the
wall made by the narrow casement,
which, after all, gave no other prospect
than a Cumberland sky, with an occasional
rook in it. But my father, I
think I have said before, did not much
care for scenery, and he looked round
with great satisfaction upon the retreat
assigned him.</p>

<p>"We can knock up shelves for your
books in no time," said my uncle,
rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"It would be a charity," quoth my
father, "for they have been very long
in a recumbent position, and would
like to stretch themselves, poor things.
My dear Roland, this room is made
for books&mdash;so round and so deep. I
shall sit here like Truth in a well."</p>

<p>"And there is a room for you, sister,
just out of it," said my uncle, opening
a little low prison-like door into a
charming room, for its window was
low, and it had an iron balcony; "and
out of that is the bed-room. For you,
Pisistratus, my boy, I am afraid that
it is soldier's quarters, indeed, with
which you will have to put up. But
never mind; in a day or two we shall
make all worthy a general of your
illustrious name&mdash;for he was a great
general, Pisistratus the First&mdash;was he
not, brother?"</p>

<p>"All tyrants are," said my father:
"the knack of soldiering is indispensable
to them."</p>

<p>"Oh, you may say what you please
here!" said Roland, in high good
humour, as he drew me down stairs,
still apologising for my quarters, and
so earnestly that I made up my mind
that I was to be put into an <em>oubliette</em>.
Nor were my suspicions much dispelled
on seeing that we had to leave
the keep, and pick our way into what
seemed to me a mere heap of rubbish,
on the dexter side of the court. But
I was agreeably surprised to find,
amidst these wrecks, a room with a
noble casement commanding the whole
country, and placed immediately over
a plot of ground cultivated as a garden.
The furniture was ample, though
homely; the floors and walls well
matted; and, altogether, despite the
inconvenience of having to cross the
courtyard to get to the rest of the
house, and being wholly without the
modern luxury of a bell, I thought
that I could not be better lodged.</p>

<p>"But this is a perfect bower, my
dear uncle! Depend on it, it was the
bower-chamber of the Dames de Caxton&mdash;heaven
rest them!"</p>

<p>"No," said my uncle, gravely; "I
suspect it must have been the chaplain's
room, for the chapel was to the
right of you. An earlier chapel, indeed,
formerly existed in the keep
tower&mdash;for, indeed, it is scarcely a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
true keep without chapel, well, and
hall. I can show you part of the roof
of the first, and the two last are entire;
the well is very curious, formed in the
substance of the wall at one angle of
the hall. In Charles the First's time,
our ancestor lowered his only son down
in a bucket, and kept him there six
hours, while a Malignant mob was
storming the tower. I need not say
that our ancestor himself scorned to
hide from such a rabble, for <em>he</em> was a
grown man. The boy lived to be a
sad spendthrift, and used the well for
cooling his wine. He drank up a
great many good acres."</p>

<p>"I should scratch him out of the
pedigree, if I were you. But, pray,
have you not discovered the proper
chamber of that great Sir William,
about whom my father is so shamefully
sceptical?"</p>

<p>"To tell you a secret," answered
the Captain, giving me a sly poke in
the ribs, "I have put your father into
it! There are the initial letters W. C.
let into the cusp of the York rose, and
the date, three years before the battle
of Bosworth, over the chimneypiece."</p>

<p>I could not help joining my uncle's
grim low laugh at this characteristic
pleasantry; and after I had complimented
him on so judicious a mode of
proving his point, I asked him how he
could possibly have contrived to fit up
the ruin so well, especially as he had
scarcely visited it since his purchase.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "about twelve
years ago, that poor fellow you now
see as my servant, and who is gardener,
bailiff, seneschal, butler, and
anything else you can put him to, was
sent out of the army on the invalid
list. So I placed him here; and as he
is a capital carpenter, and has had a
very fair education, I told him what I
wanted, and put by a small sum every
year for repairs and furnishing. It is
astonishing how little it cost me, for
Bolt, poor fellow, (that is his name,)
caught the right spirit of the thing,
and most of the furniture, (which
you see is ancient and suitable,) he
picked up at different cottages and
farmhouses in the neighbourhood. As
it is, however, we have plenty more
rooms here and there&mdash;only, of late,"
continued my uncle, slightly changing
colour, "I had no money to
spare. But come," he resumed, with
an evident effort&mdash;"come and see my
barrack: it is on the other side of the
hall, and made out of what no doubt
were the butteries."</p>

<p>We reached the yard, and found
the fly-coach had just crawled to the
door. My father's head was buried deep
in the vehicle,&mdash;he was gathering up his
packages, and sending out, oracle-like,
various muttered objurgations and
anathemas upon Mrs Primmins and
her vacuum; which Mrs Primmins,
standing by, and making a lap with
her apron to receive the packages and
anathemas simultaneously, bore with
the mildness of an angel, lifting up
her eyes to heaven and murmuring
something about "poor old bones."
Though, as for Mrs Primmins's bones,
they had been myths these twenty
years, and you might as soon have
found a Plesiosaurus in the fat lands
of Romney Marsh as a bone amidst
those layers of flesh in which my poor
father thought he had so carefully
cottoned up his Cardan.</p>

<p>Leaving these parties to adjust
matters between them, we stepped
under the low doorway, and entered
Rowland's room. Oh, certainly Bolt
<em>had</em> caught the spirit of the thing!&mdash;certainly
he had penetrated down even
to the very pathos that lay within the
deeps of Roland's character. Buffon
says "the style is the man;" there,
the room was the man. That nameless,
inexpressible, soldier-like, methodical
neatness which belonged to
Roland&mdash;that was the first thing that
struck one&mdash;that was the general character
of the whole. Then, in details,
there, in stout oak shelves, were the
books on which my father loved to
jest his more imaginative brother,&mdash;there
they were, Froissart, Barante,
Joinville, the <em>Mort d'Arthur</em>, <cite>Amadis
of Gaul</cite>, Spenser's <cite>Fairy Queen</cite>, a
noble copy of Strutt's <cite>Horda</cite>, Mallet's
<cite>Northern Antiquities</cite>, Percy's <cite>Reliques</cite>,
Pope's <cite>Homer</cite>, books on gunnery,
archery, hawking, fortification&mdash;old
chivalry and modern war together
cheek by jowl.</p>

<p>Old chivalry and modern war!&mdash;look
to that tilting helmet with the
tall Caxton crest, and look to that
trophy near it, a French cuirass&mdash;and
that old banner (a knight's pennon)
surmounting those crossed bayonets.
And over the chimneypiece there&mdash;bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
clean, and, I warrant you,
dusted daily&mdash;are Roland's own
sword, his holsters, and pistols, yea,
the saddle, pierced and lacerated,
from which he had reeled when that
leg&mdash;&mdash;I gasped&mdash;I felt it all at
a glance, and I stole softly to the
spot, and, had Roland not been there,
I could have kissed that sword as
reverently as if it had been a Bayard's
or a Sidney's.</p>

<p>My uncle was too modest to guess
my emotion; he rather thought I had
turned my face to conceal a smile at
his vanity, and said, in a deprecating
tone of apology&mdash;"It was all Bolt's
doing, foolish fellow."</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XLIX.</h3>

<p>Our host regaled us with a hospitality
that notably contrasted his
economical thrifty habits in London.
To be sure, Bolt had caught
the great pike which headed the feast;
and Bolt, no doubt, had helped to
rear those fine chickens <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab ovo</i>; Bolt,
I have no doubt, made that excellent
Spanish omelette; and for the rest,
the products of the sheepwalk and the
garden came in as volunteer auxiliaries&mdash;very
different from the mercenary
recruits by which those metropolitan
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Condottieri</i>, the butcher and
green-grocer, hasten the ruin of that
melancholy commonwealth called
"genteel poverty."</p>

<p>Our evening passed cheerfully; and
Roland, contrary to his custom, was
talker in chief. It was eleven o'clock
before Bolt appeared with a lantern
to conduct me through the court-yard
to my dormitory, among the ruins&mdash;a
ceremony which, every night, shine or
dark, he insisted upon punctiliously
performing.</p>

<p>It was long before I could sleep&mdash;before
I could believe that but so few
days had elapsed since Roland heard
of his son's death&mdash;that son whose
fate had so long tortured him; and
yet, never had Roland appeared so
free from sorrow! Was it natural&mdash;was
it effort? Several days passed
before I could answer that question,
and then not wholly to my satisfaction.
Effort there was, or rather resolute
systematic determination. At
moments Roland's head drooped, his
brows met, and the whole man seemed
to sink. Yet these were only moments;
he would rouse himself up
like a dozing charger at the sound of
a trumpet, and shake off the creeping
weight. But, whether from the
vigour of his determination, or from
some aid in other trains of reflection,
I could not but perceive that Roland's
sadness really was less grave and
bitter than it had been, or than it was
natural to suppose. He seemed to
transfer, daily more and more, his
affections from the dead to those
around him, especially to Blanche and
myself. He let it be seen that he
looked on me now as his lawful successor&mdash;as
the future supporter of his
name&mdash;he was fond of confiding to
me all his little plans, and consulting
me on them. He would walk with me
around his domains, (of which I shall
say more hereafter,)&mdash;point out, from
every eminence we climbed, where the
broad lands which his forefathers owned
stretched away to the horizon; unfold
with tender hand the mouldering pedigree,
and rest lingeringly on those of his
ancestors who had held martial post,
or had died on the field. There was
a crusader who had followed Richard
to Ascalon; there was a knight who
had fought at Agincourt; there was a
cavalier (whose picture was still extant,
with fair lovelocks) who had
fallen at Worcester&mdash;no doubt the
same who had cooled his son in that
well which the son devoted to more
agreeable associations. But of all these
worthies there was none whom my
uncle, perhaps from the spirit of contradiction,
valued like that apocryphal
Sir William: and why?&mdash;because,
when the apostate Stanley
turned the fortunes of the field at
Bosworth, and when that cry of despair&mdash;"Treason,
treason!" burst
from the lips of the last Plantagenet,
"amongst the faithless,"
this true soldier "faithful found!"
had fallen in that lion-rush which
Richard made at his foe. "Your
father tells me that Richard was a
murderer and usurper," quoth my
uncle. "Sir, that might be true or not;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
but it was not on the field of battle
that his followers were to reason on
the character of the master who
trusted them, especially when a legion
of foreign hirelings stood opposed to
them. I would not have descended
from that turncoat Stanley to be lord of
all the lands the Earls of Derby can
boast of. Sir, in loyalty, men fight
and die for a grand principle, and a
lofty passion; and this brave Sir
William was paying back to the last
Plantagenet the benefits he had received
from the first!"</p>

<p>"And yet it may be doubted," said
I maliciously, "whether William Caxton
the printer did not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Plague, pestilence, and fire seize
William Caxton the printer, and his
invention too!" cried my uncle barbarously.
"When there were only a
few books, at least they were good
ones; and now they are so plentiful,
all they do is to confound the judgment,
unsettle the reason, drive the
good books out of cultivation, and
draw a ploughshare of innovation
over every ancient landmark; seduce
the women, womanize the men, upset
states, thrones, and churches; rear a
race of chattering, conceited, coxcombs,
who can always find books in
plenty to excuse them from doing
their duty; make the poor discontented,
the rich crotchety and whimsical,
refine away the stout old
virtues into quibbles and sentiments!
All imagination formerly was expended
in noble action, adventure,
enterprise, high deeds and aspirations;
now a man can but be imaginative
by feeding on the false excitement
of passions he never felt,
dangers he never shared; and he fritters
away all there is of life to spare in
him upon the fictitious love-sorrows of
Bond Street and St James's. Sir,
chivalry ceased when the press rose!
And to fasten upon me, as a forefather,
out of all men who have ever lived
and sinned, the very man who has
most destroyed what I most valued&mdash;who,
by the Lord! with his cursed invention
has wellnigh got rid of respect
for forefathers altogether&mdash;is a cruelty
of which my brother had never been
capable, if that printer's devil had not
got hold of him!"</p>

<p>That a man in this blessed nineteenth
century should be such a
Vandal! and that my uncle Roland
should talk in a strain that Totila
would have been ashamed of, within
so short a time after my father's
scientific and erudite oration on the
Hygeiana of Books, was enough to
make one despair of the progress of
intellect and the perfectibility of our
species. And I have no manner of
doubt that, all the while, my uncle
had a brace of books in his pockets,
Robert Hall one of them! In truth,
he had talked himself into a passion,
and did not know what nonsense
he was saying, poor man. But
this explosion of Captain Roland's
has shattered the thread of my matter.
Pouff! I must take breath and
begin again!</p>

<p>Yes, in spite of my sauciness, the
old soldier evidently took to me more
and more. And, besides our critical
examination of the property
and the pedigree, he carried me
with him on long excursions to distant
villages, where some memorial of
a defunct Caxton, a coat of arms, or
an epitaph on a tombstone, might be
still seen. And he made me pore
over topographical works and county
histories, (forgetful, Goth that he
was, that for those very authorities
he was indebted to the repudiated
printer!) to find some anecdote
of his beloved dead! In truth,
the county for miles round bore
the <em>vestigia</em> of those old Caxtons;
their handwriting was on many a
broken wall. And, obscure as they
all were, compared to that great
operative of the Sanctuary at Westminster,
whom my father clung to&mdash;still,
that the yesterdays that had
lighted them the way to dusty death
had cast no glare on dishonoured
scutcheons seemed clear, from the
popular respect and traditional affection
in which I found that the name
was still held in hamlet and homestead.
It was pleasant to see the
veneration with which this small
hidalgo of some three hundred a-year
was held, and the patriarchal
affection with which he returned it.
Roland was a man who would walk
into a cottage, rest his cork leg on
the hearth, and talk for the hour
together upon all that lay nearest to
the hearts of the owners. There is a
peculiar spirit of aristocracy amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
agricultural peasants: they like old
names and families; they identify
themselves with the honours of a
house, as if of its clan. They do not
care so much for wealth as townsfolk
and the middle class do; they have a
pity, but a respectful one, for wellborn
poverty. And then this Roland,
too&mdash;who would go and dine in a
cook shop, and receive change for a
shilling, and shun the ruinous luxury
of a hack cabriolet&mdash;could be positively
extravagant in his liberalities
to those around him. He was altogether
another being in his paternal
acres. The shabby-genteel, half-pay
captain, lost in the whirl of London,
here luxuriated into a dignified case
of manner that Chesterfield might
have admired. And, if to please is
the true sign of politeness, I wish you
could have seen the faces that smiled
upon Captain Roland, as he walked
down the village, nodding from side
to side.</p>

<p>One day a frank, hearty, old
woman, who had known Roland as a
boy, seeing him lean on my arm,
stopped us, as she said bluffly, to
take a "geud luik" at me.</p>

<p>Fortunately I was stalwart enough
to pass muster, even in the eyes of
a Cumberland matron; and, after a
compliment at which Roland seemed
much pleased, she said to me, but
pointing to the Captain&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hegh, sir, now you ha the bra
time before you; you maun een try
and be as geud as <em>he</em>. And if life
last, ye wull too&mdash;for there never
waur a bad ane of that stock. Wi'
heads kindly stup'd to the least, and
lifted manfu' oop to the heighest&mdash;that
ye all war' sin ye came from the Ark.
Blessins on the ould name&mdash;though
little pelf goes with it&mdash;it sounds on
the peur man's ear like a bit o'
gould!"</p>

<p>"Do you not see now," said Roland,
as we turned away, "what we owe to a
name, and what to our forefathers?&mdash;do
you not see why the remotest ancestor
has a right to our respect and
consideration&mdash;for he was a parent?
'Honour your parents'&mdash;the law
does not say, 'Honour your children!'
If a child disgrace us, and the dead,
and the sanctity of this great heritage
of their virtues&mdash;<em>the name</em>;&mdash;if he
does&mdash;" Roland stopped short, and
added fervently, "But you are my
heir now&mdash;I have no fear! What
matters one foolish old man's sorrow?&mdash;the
name, that property
of generations, is saved, thank
Heaven&mdash;the name!"</p>

<p>Now the riddle was solved, and
I understood why, amidst all his natural
grief for a son's loss, that proud
father was consoled. For he was
less himself a father than a son&mdash;son
to the long dead. From every grave,
where a progenitor slept, he had
heard a parent's voice. He could bear
to be bereaved, if the forefathers were
not dishonoured. Roland was more
than half a Roman&mdash;the son might
still cling to his household affections,
but the <em>lares</em> were a part of his
religion.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER L.</h3>

<p>But I ought to be hard at work,
preparing myself for Cambridge. The
deuce!&mdash;how can I? The point in
academical education on which I require
most preparation is Greek composition.
I come to my father, who,
one might think, was at home enough
in this. But rare indeed is it to find
a great scholar who is a good teacher.</p>

<p>My dear father! if one is content to
take you in your own way, there never
was a more admirable instructor for
the heart, the head, the principles,
or the tastes&mdash;in your own way, when
you have discovered that there is some
one sore to be healed&mdash;one defect to
be repaired; and you have rubbed
your spectacles, and got your hand
fairly into that recess between your
frill and your waistcoat. But to go
to you, cut and dry, monotonously,
regularly&mdash;book and exercise in hand&mdash;to
see the mournful patience with
which you tear yourself from that
great volume of Cardan in the very
honeymoon of possession&mdash;and then
to note those mild eyebrows gradually
distend themselves into perplexed diagonals,
over some false quantity or
some barbarous collocation&mdash;till there
steal forth that horrible "Papæ!"
which means more on your lips than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
I am sure it ever did when Latin was
a live language, and "Papæ!" a natural
and unpedantic ejaculation!&mdash;no,
I would sooner blunder through the
dark by myself a thousand times, than
light my rush-light at the lamp of that
Phlegethonian "Papæ!"</p>

<p>And then my father would wisely
and kindly, but wondrous slowly,
erase three-fourths of one's pet verses,
and intercalate others that one saw
were exquisite, but could not exactly
see why. And then one asked why;
and my father shook his head in despair,
and said&mdash;"But you ought to
<em>feel</em> why!"</p>

<p>In short, scholarship to him was
like poetry: he could no more teach
it you than Pindar could have taught
you how to make an ode. You
breathed the aroma, but you could
no more seize and analyse it, than,
with the opening of your naked hand,
you could carry off the scent of a rose.
I soon left my father in peace to Cardan,
and to the Great Book, which
last, by the way, advanced but slowly.
For Uncle Jack had now insisted on
its being published in quarto, with
illustrative plates; and those plates
took an immense time, and were to
cost an immense sum&mdash;but that cost
was the affair of the Anti-Publisher
Society. But how can I settle to work
by myself? No sooner have I got
into my room&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penitus ab orbe divisus</i>,
as I rashly think&mdash;than there is a tap
at the door. Now, it is my mother,
who is benevolently engaged upon
making curtains to all the windows,
(a trifling superfluity that Bolt had
forgotten or disdained,) and who wants
to know how the draperies are fashioned
at Mr Trevanion's: a pretence
to have me near her, and see
with her own eyes that I am not
fretting;&mdash;the moment she hears I
have shut myself up in my room, she
is sure that it is for sorrow. Now
it is Bolt, who is making book-shelves
for my father, and desires to
consult me at every turn, especially
as I have given him a Gothic design,
which pleases him hugely. Now it is
Blanche, whom, in an evil hour, I
undertook to teach to draw, and who
comes in on tiptoe, vowing she'll not
disturb me, and sits so quiet that she
fidgets me out of all patience. Now,
and much more often, it is the Captain,
who wants me to walk, to ride,
to fish. And, by St Hubert! (saint
of the chase,) bright August comes&mdash;and
there is moor-game on those
barren wolds&mdash;and my uncle has
given me the gun he shot with at
my age&mdash;single-barrelled, flint lock&mdash;but
you would not have laughed at it
if you had seen the strange feats it
did in Roland's hands&mdash;while in mine,
I could always lay the blame on the
flint lock! Time, in short, passed
rapidly; and if Roland and I had
our dark hours, we chased them
away before they could settle&mdash;shot
them on the wing as they got up.</p>

<p>Then, too, though the immediate
scenery around my uncle's was so
bleak and desolate, the country within
a few miles was so full of objects of
interest&mdash;of landscapes so poetically
grand or lovely; and occasionally we
coaxed my father from the Cardan,
and spent whole days by the margin
of some glorious lake.</p>

<p>Amongst these excursions, I made
one by myself to that house in which
my father had known the bliss and
the pangs of that stern first love that
still left its scars fresh on my own
memory. The house, large and imposing,
was shut up&mdash;the Trevanions
had not been there for years&mdash;the
pleasure-grounds had been contracted
into the smallest possible space. There
was no positive decay or ruin&mdash;that
Trevanion would never have allowed;
but there was the dreary look of absenteeship
everywhere. I penetrated
into the house with the help of my
card and half-a-crown. I saw that
memorable boudoir&mdash;I could fancy the
very spot in which my father had
heard the sentence that had changed
the current of his life. And when I
returned home, I looked with new
tenderness on my father's placid brow&mdash;and
blessed anew that tender helpmate,
who, in her patient love, had
chased from it every shadow.</p>

<p>I had received one letter from Vivian
a few days after our arrival. It
had been redirected from my father's
house, at which I had given him my
address. It was short, but seemed
cheerful. He said, that he believed
he had at last hit on the right way,
and should keep to it&mdash;that he and
the world were better friends than
they had been&mdash;and that the only way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to keep friends with the world was to
treat it as a tamed tiger, and have
one hand on a crow-bar while one
fondled the beast with the other. He
enclosed me a bank-note which somewhat
more than covered his debt to
me, and bade me pay him the surplus
when he should claim it as a millionnaire.
He gave me no address in his
letter, but it bore the post-mark of
Godalming. I had the impertinent
curiosity to look into an old topographical
work upon Surrey, and in a
supplemental itinerary I found this
passage, "To the left of the beech-wood,
three miles from Godalming,
you catch a glimpse of the elegant
seat of Francis Vivian, Esq." To
judge by the date of the work, the
said Francis Vivian might be the
grandfather of my friend, his namesake.
There could no longer be any
doubt as to the parentage of this prodigal
son.</p>

<p>The long vacation was now nearly
over, and all his guests were to leave
the poor Captain. In fact, we had
made a long trespass on his hospitality.
It was settled that I was to
accompany my father and mother to
their long-neglected <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penates</i>, and start
thence for Cambridge.</p>

<p>Our parting was sorrowful&mdash;even
Mrs Primmins wept as she shook
hands with Bolt. But Bolt, an old
soldier, was of course a lady's man.
The brothers did not shake hands
only&mdash;they fondly embraced, as
brothers of that time of life rarely do
now-a-days, except on the stage. And
Blanche, with one arm round my
mother's neck, and one round mine,
sobbed in my ear,&mdash;"But I will be
your little wife, I will." Finally, the
fly-coach once more received us all&mdash;all
but poor Blanche, and we looked
round and missed her.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER LI.</h3>

<p>Alma Mater! Alma Mater! New-fashioned
folks, with their large
theories of education, may find fault
with thee. But a true Spartan
mother thou art&mdash;hard and stern as
the old matron who bricked up her
son Pausanias, bringing the first
stone to immure him; hard and
stern, I say, to the worthless, but
full of majestic tenderness to the
worthy.</p>

<p>For a young man to go up to Cambridge
(I say nothing of Oxford,
knowing nothing thereof) merely as
routine work, to lounge through three
years to a degree among the ὁι πολλοι&mdash;for
such an one, Oxford Street herself,
whom the immortal Opium-eater hath
so direly apostrophised, is not a more
careless and stony-hearted mother.
But for him who will read, who will
work, who will seize the rare advantages
proffered, who will select his
friends judiciously&mdash;yea, out of that
vast ferment of young idea in its lusty
vigour, choose the good and reject
the bad&mdash;there is plenty to make those
three years rich with fruit imperishable&mdash;three
years nobly spent, even
though one must pass over the Ass's
Bridge to get into the Temple of
Honour.</p>

<p>Important changes in the Academical
system have been recently announced,
and honours are henceforth
to be accorded to the successful disciples
in moral and natural sciences.
By the side of the old throne of
Mathesis, they have placed two very
useful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fauteuils à la Voltaire</i>. I
have no objection; but, in those three
years of life, it is not so much the thing
learned, as the steady perseverance in
learning something that is excellent.</p>

<p>It was fortunate, in one respect, for
me that I had seen a little of the real
world&mdash;the metropolitan, before I
came to that mimic one&mdash;the cloistral.
For what were called pleasures in the
last, and which might have allured
me, had I come fresh from school,
had no charm for me now. Hard
drinking and high play, a certain
mixture of coarseness and extravagance,
made the fashion among the
idle when I was at the university <em>sub
consule Planco</em>&mdash;when Wordsworth
was master of Trinity: it may be
altered now.</p>

<p>But I had already outlived such
temptations, and so, naturally, I was
thrown out of the society of the idle,
and somewhat into that of the laborious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Still, to speak frankly, I had no
longer the old pleasure in books. If
my acquaintance with the great world
had destroyed the temptation to puerile
excesses, it had also increased my
constitutional tendency to practical
action. And, alas! in spite of all the
benefit I had derived from Robert
Hall, there were times when memory
was so poignant that I had no choice
but to rush from the lonely room,
haunted by tempting phantoms too
dangerously fair, and sober down the
fever of the heart by some violent
bodily fatigue. The ardour which
belongs to early youth, and which it
best dedicates to knowledge, had
been charmed prematurely to shrines
less severely sacred. Therefore,
though I laboured, it was with that
full <em>sense of labour</em> which (as I found
at a much later period of life) the
truly triumphant student never knows.
Learning&mdash;that marble image&mdash;warms
into life, not at the toil of the chisel,
but the worship of the sculptor. The
mechanical workman finds but the
voiceless stone.</p>

<p>At my uncle's, such a thing as a
newspaper rarely made its appearance.
At Cambridge, even among
reading men, the newspapers had
their due importance. Politics ran
high; and I had not been three days
at Cambridge before I heard Trevanion's
name. Newspapers, therefore,
had their charms for me. Trevanion's
prophecy about himself
seemed about to be fulfilled. There
were rumours of changes in the
cabinet. Trevanion's name was
bandied to and fro, struck from praise
to blame, high and low, as a shuttlecock.
Still the changes were not
made, and the cabinet held firm.
Not a word in the <cite>Morning Post</cite>,
under the head of <em>fashionable intelligence</em>,
as to rumours that would have
agitated me more than the rise and
fall of governments&mdash;no hint of "the
speedy nuptials of the daughter and
sole heiress of a distinguished and
wealthy commoner:" only now and
then, in enumerating the circle of
brilliant guests at the house of
some party chief, I gulped back the
heart that rushed to my lips, when
I saw the names of Lady Ellinor and
Miss Trevanion.</p>

<p>But amongst all that prolific
progeny of the periodical press&mdash;remote
offspring of my great namesake
and ancestor, (for I hold the
faith of my father,)&mdash;where was
the <cite>Literary Times</cite>?&mdash;what had
so long retarded its promised blossoms?
Not a leaf in the shape of
advertisements had yet emerged from
its mother earth. I hoped from my
heart that the whole thing was abandoned,
and would not mention it in
my letters home, lest I should revive
the mere idea of it. But, in default
of the <cite>Literary Times</cite>, there did appear
a new journal, a daily journal
too; a tall, slender, and meagre stripling,
with a vast head, by way of prospectus,
which protruded itself for three
weeks successively at the top of the
leading article;&mdash;with a fine and subtle
body of paragraphs;&mdash;and the smallest
legs, in the way of advertisements,
that any poor newspaper ever stood
upon! And yet this attenuated journal
had a plump and plethoric title,
a title that smacked of turtle and
venison; an aldermanic, portly, grandiose,
Falstaffian title&mdash;it was called
<span class="smcap">The Capitalist</span>. And all those
fine subtle paragraphs were larded
out with receipts how to make money.
There was an El Dorado in every sentence.
To believe that paper, you
would think no man had ever yet found
a proper return for his pounds, shillings,
and pence. You would have
turned up your nose at twenty per
cent. There was a great deal about
Ireland&mdash;not her wrongs, thank Heaven!
but her fisheries: a long inquiry
what had become of the pearls for
which Britain was once so famous: a
learned disquisition upon certain lost
gold mines now happily rediscovered:
a very ingenious proposition to turn
London smoke into manure, by a new
chemical process: recommendations
to the poor to hatch chickens in ovens
like the ancient Egyptians: agricultural
schemes for sowing the waste
lands in England with onions, upon
the system adopted near Bedford, net
produce one hundred pounds an acre.
In short, according to that paper,
every rood of ground might well
maintain its man, and every shilling
be like Hobson's money-bag, "the
fruitful parent of a hundred more."
For three days, at the newspaper
room of the Union Club, men talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of this journal: some pished, some
sneered, some wondered; till an ill-natured
mathematician, who had just
taken his degree, and had spare time
on his hands, sent a long letter to the
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, showing up more
blunders, in some article to which the
editor of <cite>The Capitalist</cite> had specially
invited attention, (unlucky dog!) than
would have paved the whole island of
Laputa. After that time, not a soul
read <cite>The Capitalist</cite>. How long it
dragged on its existence I know not;
but it certainly did not die of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maladie
de langueur</i>.</p>

<p>Little thought I, when I joined in
the laugh against <cite>The Capitalist</cite>,
that I ought rather to have followed it
to its grave, in black crape and weepers,&mdash;unfeeling
wretch that I was!
But, like a poet, O <cite>Capitalist</cite>! thou
wert not discovered, and appreciated,
and prized, and mourned, till thou
wert dead and buried, and the bill
came in for thy monument!</p>

<p>The first term of my college life
was just expiring, when I received a
letter from my mother, so agitated,
so alarming, at first reading so unintelligible,
that I could only see that
some great misfortune had befallen
us; and I stopped short and dropped
on my knees, to pray for the life and
health of those whom that misfortune
more specially seemed to menace; and
then&mdash;and then, towards the end of
the last blurred sentence&mdash;read twice,
thrice, over&mdash;I could cry, "Thank
Heaven, thank Heaven! it is only,
then, money after all!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>STATISTICAL ACCOUNTS OF SCOTLAND.</h2>


<p>It is a term of very wide application,
this of statistics&mdash;extending to
everything in the state of a country
subject to variation either from the
energies and fancies of men, or from the
operations of nature, in so far as these,
or the knowledge of them, has any
tendency to occasion change in the
condition of the country. Its elements
must be either changeable in
themselves, or the cause of change;
because the use of the whole matter
is to direct men what to do for their
advantage, moral or physical&mdash;by
legislation, when the case is of sufficient
magnitude&mdash;or otherwise by the
wisdom and enterprise of individuals.</p>

<p>Governments, it is plain, must
have the greatest interest in possessing
knowledge of this sort; but they
have not been the first to engage
very earnestly in obtaining it. It
would seem that, in all countries, the
first very noticeable efforts in this
way have been made by individuals.</p>

<p>In this country we have now from
government more and better statistics
than from any other source; for
besides the decennial census, there is
the yearly produce in this way of
Crown Commissions and of Parliamentary
Committees; and, moreover,
there is the late institution of a statistical
department in connexion with
the Board of Trade, for arranging,
digesting, and rendering more accessible
all matter of this kind collected,
from time to time, by the different
branches of the administration. But
before statistical knowledge became
the object of much care to the government
of this country, it had been
well cultivated by individuals. So in
Germany statistics first took a scientific
form in the works of an individual
about the middle of the last century:
and in France, the unfinished <cite>Mémoires
des Intendants</cite>, prepared on the
order of the king, were scarcely an
exception, since meant for the private
instruction of the young prince. But
without attaching undue importance
to the fact of mere precedence, it may
be said that, considering the chief uses
of this kind of knowledge, it has
received more contributions from
individuals than could have been expected.</p>

<p>This admits of being easily explained.
It has been well said that,
while history is a sort of current statistics,
statistics are a sort of stationary
history. The one has therefore much
the same invitations to mere literary
taste as the other; and if the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
be not so generally engaging, the fancy
way be as strong, and produce as
pure a devotion to statistics as there
ever is to history. More than this,
the statist may care far less for his
subject than its uses,&mdash;that is, he may
choose to undergo the toil of researches
only recommended by the chance of
their ministering to the better guidance
of some part of public policy, and
therefore to the public good. The impulse
is then not literary; nor is it
legislative, for the power is wanting;
it is simply patriotic, for so it must
be considered, even when, in the words
of Mr M'Culloch, the object is only
"to bring under the public view the
deficiencies in statistical information,
and so to contribute to the advancement
of the science."</p>

<p>This public nature of the aim of
statistical works, and the unlikelihood
of their authors choosing that medium
to set forth anything supposed worthy
of notice in the figure of their own
genius, seem to have been recognised,
except in rare instances, as giving to
works of this kind a title to be well
received, and to have their faults very
gently remarked.</p>

<p>Again, it might be expected that
the statistics of individuals should
have a more limited range than those
of governments; that they should
refer to districts of less extent; and
to the state of the country in fewer of
its aspects. But the case is somewhat
different. The statistics of individuals
are often more national than local,
and generally consist of many branches
presented in some connexion; while
those of governments are commonly
confined to the single department on
which some question of policy may
chance for the time to have fixed
attention.</p>

<p>On the occasion mentioned, the inquiries
instituted in France were not
so confined, but embraced all the
points of chief interest in the state of
the country. In England, nothing
similar has been attempted; although,
some years ago, it is known that a
proposal to institute a general survey
of Ireland&mdash;on the plan, we believe,
of the Ordnance Survey of the parish
of Templemore&mdash;was for some time
under consideration of the government.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the instances of
individual enterprise in this way to a
national extent are numerous, both
at home and abroad. Among the
latter, Aucherwall gives the first example,
and Peuchet probably the
best; both treating of the country
not in parts but as a whole,&mdash;not in
one respect but in many. Of the
same sort are the excellent statistical
works of Colquhoun, M'Culloch,
Porter, and others, relating to the
British empire, and directed to many
aspects of its condition. To these
we add the <cite>Statistical Account of Scotland</cite>,&mdash;occupied
with as many or
more matters of inquiry, but not so
properly national, since viewing not
the country collectively, but its parochial
divisions in succession.</p>

<p>One advantage belongs to the collection
of statistics upon many points,
which is not found in those that are
limited to one. It is remarked by
Schlozer in his <cite>Theorie der Statistik</cite>,
that "there are many facts seemingly
of no value, but which become important
as soon as you combine them
with other facts, it may be of quite
another class. The affinities subsisting
among these facts are discovered
by the talent and genius of
the statist; and the more various the
knowledge he possesses, with so much
the more success he will perform this
last and crowning part of his task."
The observation need not be confined
to facts apparently unimportant: for
even those, whose importance is at
once perceived, may acquire a new
value from a skilful collation. In
either case, there seems a necessity
for remitting the detached statistics
collected by government to some
such department as that in connexion
with the Board of Trade; otherwise,
the works of individual statists must
continue to afford the only opportunity
of tracing the latent relations
of one branch of statistics to
another.</p>

<p>The individual, however, who attempts
so much, is in hazard of
attempting more than any individual
can well perform. For, besides this,
he has to make another effort quite
distinct&mdash;in the investigation of facts.
All the needed scientific knowledge he
may possess; but the same sufficiency
of local or topographical knowledge is
not supposable. The work so produced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
therefore, cannot easily avoid
the defects, either of error in the
details of some branch, of unequal
development of the parts, or of a
superficial treatment of the whole.
Against these dangers some writers
have had recourse to assistance, inviting
contributions from others favoured
with better means of information
than themselves; and to them
attributing, in so far as they assisted,
the entire merit and responsibility of
the work.</p>

<p>This transference of responsibility is
warranted by the necessity of the
case&mdash;but it is unusual; and as it
scarcely occurs except in works of the
kind in question, it may happen that
even a professing judge of such works,
if the habit of attention be not good,
may entirely overlook the circumstance.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Statistical Account of Scotland</cite>,
the obligation to individual contributions
has been carried to the
greatest extent; indeed, it is simply a
collection of such contributions, and
nothing more. This part of the plan
was necessitated by another, in which
the work is equally peculiar&mdash;namely,
the distinct treatment of smaller divisions
of the country, than have been
taken up in any other work of the
kind, having an entire country for
its object. To obtain a body of parochial
statistics, it was necessary to
have recourse to persons well acquainted
with the bounds, and intelligent,
at the same time, upon the various
subjects of inquiry. But to find
such in nine hundred parishes would,
of itself, have required much of that
local knowledge, the want of which
was the occasion of the search&mdash;had
there not been a class or order of men
among whom the desired qualification,
in many points, might be supposed to
be pretty generally diffused; and from
whose favour to a project of public
usefulness much aid might be expected.
It was in this manner that the
co-operation of the parochial clergy
came to be suggested.</p>

<p>The <cite>Statistical Account of Scotland</cite>
was originated, promoted, and superintended
by the late Sir John Sinclair.
The authors of such works, as one of
the best of them remarks, should be
careful to explain their motives in
undertaking it&mdash;we presume, because
undertakings of the kind are felt to
be scarcely an affair of individuals.
In this instance, a desire to promote
the public good was at once professed
and accredited by many other acts
apparently inspired by the same sentiment.
The devotion of Sir John
Sinclair's life in that direction was
complete, and the example uncommon.
In this a late reviewer perceives
nothing more than a restless pursuit of
plans of no further interest to himself
than as they bore the inscription of
his own name. But whenever public
spirit is professed, and by anything
like useful acts attested, our faith, we
think, should be more generous. On
such occasions, if on any, it is right
to waive all speculation upon private
motives, and to presume the best&mdash;for
reasons so well understood in
general that they do not need to be
explained. But if genius, with a
bent to that sort of penetration, must
have its freedom, we do demand that
some token should appear of a belief
in the possibility of the virtue which
is denied.</p>

<p>It does not improve the grace of
any such judgments that they are
passed fifty years after the occasion;
for, in the meantime, the work may
have acquired merits which could not
belong to it at first:&mdash;and so it has
happened with the <cite>Statistical Account</cite>
of Sir John Sinclair. Results may
be fairly ascribed to that performance
which were not intended nor
foreseen, and which seem to have come
from its very defects, as well as from
the defects which it revealed in the
condition of the country, and in the
means of ascertaining what the condition
of the country was. Its population-statistics
were extremely imperfect;
the census followed in a very
few years. Its scanty and unequal
notices of agriculture suggested the
project of the County Reports; and
to these succeeded the <cite>General Report
of Scotland</cite>&mdash;a work still useful, and
of the first authority in much that
relates to the agriculture and other
industry of the country. To take advantage
of those capabilities which
the statistical accounts had shown his
country to possess, Sir John Sinclair
originated the Agricultural Society.
All of those things, and more, appear
to have resulted from the <i>Statistical Account</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
They are honours that have
arisen to it in the course of time, and
may be fairly permitted to mitigate
the notice and recollection of its
faults.</p>

<p>After the lapse of fifty years, Scotland
had ceased to be the country represented
in the old <cite>Statistical Account</cite>;
for the greater part of what is proper
to such a work is, as we have said,
changeable and changing. It contained
not a little, however, which
remained as true and as interesting as
at first: the topography, the physical
characters, the civil divisions of the
country were the same; all that had
been said of its history, whether local
or general, might be said again as seasonably
as before. It occurred, then,
to those to whom the author had presented
the right of this work, to attempt
to restore it in those parts which
time had rendered useless, preserving
those which were under no disadvantage
from that cause. This, as we
learn, was the plain, unambitious intention
of the <cite>New Statistical Account
of Scotland</cite>. It was projected and
carried on during ten years by a Society,
whose object it is to afford aid,
where aid is needed, in the education
of the children of the clergy of the
Church of Scotland. Nothing could
be more foreign to that object than to
engage in a work of national statistics;
nothing more natural than that, in
their relation to the clergy, and with
their interest in the first work, they
should propose to renew it in the manner
mentioned. A society expressly formed
for statistical purposes, and not restrained
like the Society for the Sons
and Daughters of the Clergy, would probably
have proposed something different&mdash;something
more new; it might
have been expected to produce something
more excellent&mdash;though, even in
that case, the demand of excellence
would have been limited by the consideration,
that the means of completely
investigating the statistics of
a country are not at the command of
any statistical society that exists. A
modernisation, so to speak, of the first
work appears to have been the idea of
the second.</p>

<p>It has been executed, however, in
the freest style, and scarcely admitted,
indeed, of being accomplished at
all in any other manner. In such
cases, it is seldom that the adaptation
is effected by mere numerical
changes; the whole statement, in form,
manner, and substance, behoves to be
remodelled. Then, certain parts of
the original may have been deficient,
and become more evidently so by the
changes that have since ensued in the
state of the object: here the task is
less one of correction than of supplement.
For example, the very interesting
and full accounts of mining and
manufacturing industry which abound
in the new work are nearly peculiar
to it, and have scarcely an example in
the old. One entire section of the
latter, that of natural history, has been
developed to an extent not attempted
in the former, nor indeed in any other
statistical work. These are rather
noticeable licenses, on the supposition
of the aim being as moderate as professed,
and they go far to form a new
and independent work&mdash;having nothing
in common with the first, except the
parochial divisions and the obligation
to the clergy, as respects the plan; and
as respects the matter, only the small
part of it which is historical, and
therefore not obsolete.</p>

<p>We observe, accordingly, that the
society who promoted the new work
have put it forward as taking some
things from the old, for which they
are not responsible, but as containing
far more which must form a new and
separate character for itself. In both
respects, we think they have viewed
the work with a proper reference to
the conditions under which it was produced.</p>

<p>In other points, the new Account has
improved upon the old, and might be
expected to do so. It has more matter,
by a third part, neither less suited
to the place, nor more diffuse in the
statement; and, as befits a work of
reference, the arrangement is more
orderly and more uniform. It is, on
the whole, more carefully and better
written, and shows, on the part of the
reverend contributors, a remarkable
advance in the many sorts of knowledge
requisite to the task. If the
comparison were pursued further, it
might be said that some contributions
to the first are not surpassed in the
value of what they contain; while,
from the greater novelty of the task
at that time, as well as from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
greater freedom of the method, they
are somewhat fresher and more genial
in manner. The later work, if fuller,
more exact, more statistical throughout,
possesses that advantage at the
cost of appearing sometimes more
like a collection of returns in answer
to submitted points of inquiry,&mdash;a character,
however, by no means unsuitable
to a compilation of the kind. In
all other points a decided superiority
must be attributed to the new Account.</p>

<p>Our remarks at this time shall be
confined to the plan of the new Account,
and to the general description
of its contents.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The chief feature of the plan is the
distinct treatment of each parish&mdash;producing
a body neither of county nor
of national, but merely of parochial
statistics. This was the design, and
there is much to recommend it. It
is the last thing that can take the
aspect of a fault in statistics, to view
the matter in very minute portions;
for thus, and thus only, it is possible to
arrive at an accurate knowledge of
the whole. There can be no good
county statistics which do not suppose
inquiries limited, at first, to lesser
divisions of the country, and which do
not express the sum of particulars
taken from subdivisions that can
hardly proceed too far. If such minor
surveys do not come before the public,
they are presumptively carried on in
private. But, in the latter case, they
are the more apt to be superficial, as
they can be so with the less chance
of being noticed; they are apt to
take aid from mere computation of
averages; they are apt, also, to result
in that vague description which is the
master-vice of statistics. "In this
town, there are manufactures which
employ <em>many</em> hands; in this district,
<em>vast</em> quantities of silk are produced.
These," says Schlozer, "are pet
phrases of tourists, who would say
something, when they know nothing;
but they are not the language of
statistics." The parochial method
stands, then, on two good grounds: it
is inevitable either in an open or a
latent form; and it favours the collection
of sufficient data for those specific
enumerations which are the true
worth and the characteristic grace of
this branch of knowledge.</p>

<p>This plan, however, has some disadvantages;
in referring to which we
shall find occasion to bring to view
some of the proper merits of the work.</p>

<p>In the first place, a work on this
plan is inevitably voluminous. The
territorial divisions submitted to distinct
treatment are about nine hundred
in number, and the matter is
still further augmented by the occasional
assignment to different hands
of different parts of the survey of a
single parish. In proportion to the
descent of the details, is the bulk of
the production; which we suppose to be
an evil in the same measure in which it
exceeds the necessity of the case. Now
the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite> is at once
seen to contain not a little matter of
merely local interest, and of the
smallest value considered as pertaining
to a body of national statistics;
and here, if anywhere, it is apt to be
regarded as at fault. It is right, however,
to recollect the privilege of every
work to be judged according to the
conditions of the species to which it
belongs. The present is not set
forth as a statistical account of Scotland,
but as a collection of the statistical
accounts of all the parishes in
Scotland; for this, we perceive, is
not merely implied in the plan of the
work, but is declared in the prospectus,
where the hope is expressed that, by
exhibiting the actual state of the
parishes, with whatever is therein
amiss, it may lead to parochial improvements.
It does not appear, therefore,
to have been from any miscalculation
of their worth, that matters of
merely local interest have been so
liberally admitted; and, all things
considered, more of that nature might
have been expected. Let us quote
again from the best theory of statistics
that has ever been produced. "An
object may be deserving of remark in
the description of some particular
portion of a country, and at the same
time have no claim to notice in any
general account of that country at
large. In the former case, the rivulet
is not to be omitted; in the latter,
any allusion to it would be a defect,
for it would be matter of unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and trifling detail."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is recorded,
in the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite>,
that "Will-o'-wisp had never appeared
in the parish of South Uist
previous to the year 1812." Nothing,
in a national point of view, can be
conceived more insignificant than this
fact; but, taken in connexion with a
notable superstition in that district,
its local importance appears.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> To
the credit of this method, it may be
noticed, that the accounts which are
most parochial are, at the same time,
among those which have been drawn
up with the most general intelligence;
and, this being the case, it is not a
strange wish that the accounts, in
general, had been somewhat more
parochial than they are.</p>

<p>On this plan, it is certain there is
a risk of much repetition, many
parishes having some common characterists
which, in place of being
recounted for each, might be stated
once for all. How far does the
<cite>Statistical Account</cite> offend in this manner?
It is true that, where the same
facts occur in many parishes, a single
statement might suffice; though this
might be at the cost of violating the
plan which for the whole it might be
fittest to adopt, upon consideration
that the like resemblance is not found
among the greater number of the
parishes. But it is remarkable, how
seldom different parishes have all the
similarity requisite for such a common
description; for, in statistics, a difference
in mere number or quantity is
a vital difference, and expresses
essentially different facts. Many
parishes have the same articles of produce;
while no two produce exactly the
same quantities. A very short distance
often brings to view considerable
varieties in climate, soil, and other
physical qualities of a country. Now,
considering that the object of this
work is to present the parishes in their
distinguishing, as well as in their
common features, we do not see much
sameness in the substance of the details
which could have been avoided.
A sameness there is; but more in
form than in substance&mdash;each account
delivering its matter under the same
general heads, recurring in all cases
in exactly the same order. This is
convenient when the book is used for
reference; it may be wearisome to
one who reads only for amusement: it is
monotonous; but who looks for any
"soul of harmony" in such a quarter?
We repeat, it is not attended, on the
whole, with much importunate reappearance
of the same facts, and
cannot seem to be so, except to a very
careless or distempered eye. But if,
perchance, there may be some facts
much alike in several parishes, this
itself is an unusual fact, and we should
not object to its coming out in the
usual way of each parish speaking for
itself; in which case, there is always
a chance of some variety in the description,
from the same thing presenting
itself to different persons
under different aspects. But, on the
whole, we think there is less repetition
in these accounts, and indeed less
occasion for it, than might at first
sight be supposed.</p>

<p>There is another obvious tendency
to imperfection in the plan of parochial
accounts. Their first, but not
their sole object, is to describe the
parishes; it is certainly meant that
they should furnish, at the same
time, the grounds of statistical computation
for the whole country.
This is the natural complement and
the proper conclusion to a work of
parish statistics. It is, however, a
part of the plan which, not being quite
necessary, and requiring a fresh effort
at the last, is apt to be omitted. It
was not till twenty-five years after
the publication of the old Account that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Sir John Sinclair at length produced
his <em>Analysis of the Statistical Account
of Scotland considered as one District</em>.
It came too late. A similar analysis
or summary appears to have been at
first intended for the new Account:
and we regret that this part of the
design was, by force of circumstances,
not carried into effect.
One use of it would have been to
evince that parochial statistics do not
assume the character of national;
while yet, for even national statistics,
they furnish the most proper foundation.
To pass at once, however, from
parochial to national statistics would
have been too great a step; there is
an intermediate stage, at which the new
Account would certainly have paused,
though it had designed to proceed
farther; and at which, without that
design, it has here rested; presenting
the statistics of each county in a summary
of the more important particulars
concerning the included parishes;
but making no nearer approach to any
general computations for the country
at large.</p>

<p>The method of proceeding from
parishes to counties suggests that
other plan for the entire work, which
would have followed the opposite
course&mdash;the plan that would have
begun with counties, and given County,
not Parochial reports. Somewhat in
this fashion has been formed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Géographie
Départementale</i> of France, now
in course of publication, in which the
whole matter is rigorously subjected
to as skilful an arrangement as has
ever been devised for matters of the
kind. It is plain, however, that greater
difficulty and more expense would have
attended the construction of the Scotch
work on that scheme, than private
parties could have undertaken; and
even the example of the French work
does not show that, for the compacter
method thus obtained, there might not
have been a sacrifice of much that is
valuable in detail.</p>

<p>It may be added, that when parishes
are well described, and a county or
more general summary succeeds, we
ask no more; a work like this has
then accomplished its object, and what
remains must be sought for elsewhere.
What remains is this&mdash;to interpret
the statistics thus laid down, for they
are often very far from interpreting
themselves; to ascertain, by analysis
or combination of their different parts,
what they signify in regard to the condition
of the country. Thus, betwixt
the rate of wages and the habits of a
people&mdash;the prevailing occupations
and the rate of mortality&mdash;the description
of industry and the amount of
pauperism&mdash;there are relations which
it is exceedingly important to remark.
But if a statistical account simply
notes the kind, number, or quantity of
each of these particulars, it performs
its part,&mdash;no matter how blindly, how
unconsciously of the relation that subsists
betwixt them, this may be done.
The rest is so different a work, that it
must be left to other hands. It is not
to be forgotten, that, for bringing out
the more latent truths of statistics in
the manner mentioned, a work like
this is merely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour servir</i>; and, keeping
that in view, our prepossessions
are all in favour of abundance and
minuteness of detail.</p>

<p>Lastly, a work made up of contributions
from nine hundred individuals
must be of unequal merit, according
to the different measures of intelligence
or care, and according to the feeling
with which a task of that nature may
happen to have been undertaken. A
slight inspection, accordingly, discovers
that it is the character of the
writer, more than of the parish, that
determines the length and interest of
any one of these reports. This is an
imperfection, and something more&mdash;for
it makes one part of the book, by implication,
reveal the defects of another. A
few years ago, when a Crown commission
considered a project for a general
survey and statistical report of Ireland,
their attention was much attracted to
the <cite>New Statistical Account of Scotland</cite>;
and, in their report, they notice,
in the course of a very fair estimate,
this inequality as the main disadvantage
of the plan. It is, however, inevitable,
except upon a scheme which,
from the expense attending it, would
have hindered the existence of the
Scottish work, and which appears
to have prevented or postponed the
Irish. From a single author, something
like proportion might be expected
in the parts of such a compilation;
but to that perfection a work like the
<cite>Statistical Account of Scotland</cite>, with
its hundreds of avowed responsible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and therefore uncontrolled authors,
could not pretend. For this reason,
it is the more proper to follow a rule
of judgment which, in any case, is a
good one:&mdash;to estimate the general
character of the work with a lively
recollection of its merits; and to be
much upon our guard against the
mean instinct of looking only to the
weaker and more peccant parts of it.</p>

<p>Passing from the plan to the matter
of the work, we now ask, whether all
that it contains is properly statistical,
and whether it contains all of any
consequence that falls under that description.</p>

<p>Nothing, we suppose, is alien to
this branch of knowledge that tends,
in however little, to show the state of
a country&mdash;social, political, moral&mdash;or
even physical.</p>

<p>But this last, comprising somewhat
of geography and natural history,
some writers would remove entirely
from the sphere of statistics. Among
these is Peuchet, in his work before
mentioned&mdash;who gives as the reason
of the exclusion, that, in any analysis
of the wealth or power of a state,
neither its geography nor natural history
ever come into view: a fact rather
hastily assumed. The parallel work
for this country, by Mr. M'Culloch,
while it follows Peuchet's method in
much, leaves it in this instance, admitting
various branches of natural
history to ample consideration. It is
true that trespass on the proper
ground of statistics has been so common
an offence, that writers have been
careful to mark those cases in which
no title exists. Thus Schlozer, looking
to the intrusions that come from
the quarter we refer to, is averse to
all imaginative descriptions of the
physical aspect of a country, but does
not prohibit natural history. Hogel,
who also writes well upon the theory
of statistics,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is more explicit&mdash;admitting
that natural history may encroach
too far, but asserting that its
several branches may be received to
a certain extent. "Whatever, in
the physical nature of a country, has
any influence upon the life, occupations,
or manners of the people, pertains
to statistics; by all means,
therefore, in any body of statistics, let
us have as much of mineralogy, hydrology,
botany, geology, meteorology,
as has any bearing upon the condition
of the people." All of these subjects
have been allowed to enter largely
into the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite>.</p>

<p>They form a feature of that work
which scarcely belonged to the old
Account, and which is new, indeed, to
parochial statistics. Investigations
of natural history have usually been
carried on with reference to other
bounds than those of parishes; but,
when confined to parishes, it is remarkable
how much this has been at
once for the advantage of the science,
and for the enhancement of any interest
in these territorial divisions by
the picturesque mixture of natural
objects with the works and pursuits of
men. More of this parochial treatment
of natural history we may possibly
have hereafter, upon the suggestion of
the <cite>Statistical Account</cite>.</p>

<p>For the abundant favour which the
work has shown to the whole subject
of natural history, reasons are not
wanting. One portion of that matter
has obviously the quality that designates
for statistical treatment,&mdash;comprising,
for example, mines, whether
wrought or unwrought; animals, profitable
or destructive; plants, in all
their variety of uses: the connexion
of which with the wealth and industry
of the country is at once apparent.
The same connexion exists for another
class of objects; but not so obviously.
For example, there is a detailed
account of the flowering periods of a
variety of plants in one parish; the
pertinence of which is not perceived,
until it is mentioned that, in the same
neighbourhood, there are two populous
and well-frequented watering-places,
which owe their prosperity to the qualities
of the climate: there the trade
of the locality connects itself with the
early honours of the hepaticas. A
third class of facts, and not the least
in amount, is not qualified by any relation
they are known to possess to
the social condition of the country;
but then they belong to a body of
facts, some of which have that relation;
and the same may be established
for them hereafter. Still, it
may be said that the matter, if appropriate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
behoves to be presented in a
statistical, not in a scientific form.
But this, perhaps, is to interpret too
strictly the laws of statistical writing,
which do not seem to forbid the predominance
of a scientific interest in
the description, when the matter fairly
belongs to the province of statistics.
And if any license at all may be
allowed in works of so severe a character,
it is precisely here where that is least
unbefitting. It is not among the faults
of the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite>, but
rather among its most interesting features,
that the mineral resources of the
country are so often described with all
the skill and passion of the mineralogist,
forgetting for the moment everything
but the phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>Under the head of Natural History,
we have many instances of the landscape
painting proscribed by Schlozer.
But it is remarked, that the same
authority, when adverting to another
matter, lays down a principle of admission
which is equally applicable
here. "Antiquities," he observes,
"become a proper subject of statistics
in such a case as that of Rome,
where a large amount of money was
at one time annually expended by the
strangers who came to form their
taste, or to indulge their curiosity,
upon the remains of ancient art." In
like manner, if there are places in
Scotland that profit economically by
the attractions of their natural beauty,
we do not see that there is any obligation
to be silent upon the cause, by
reason merely of the seeming dissonance
betwixt an imaginative description
and the austere account of statistics.
Other and better apologies
might be offered; and, on the whole, we
are not satisfied that, in this respect,
any less indulgence of the gentler
vein would have been attended with
advantage to the work.</p>

<p>On these grounds it appears to have
been, that so much scope is allowed to
the whole subject of natural history.
But if too much, the fault has been
redeemed by the frequent excellence
of what is put forth on that head.
Here the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite> passes
expectation; and to it we may attribute
much of the increased interest
that has lately attached to that branch
of knowledge in Scotland.</p>

<p>Another thing of questionable connexion
with statistics is history, which
imports a reference to the past;
whereas, as the name declares, statistics
contemplates but the present,
and can look neither backward nor forward,
without trenching upon other
provinces. Many excellent statistical
works, accordingly, have allowed no
place to history at all; and the writers
before cited, on the theory of the subject,
concur in excluding it. Hogel is
most explicit. "Statistics never go
beyond the circle of the present in
their representations of the condition
of a country: they are like painting&mdash;they
fix upon a single point of time;
and the facts which they select are
those which come last in the series,
though the series they belong to may
extend backwards for ages. All that
went before rests on testimony, and
is therefore beyond the sphere of statistics,
whose grounds are in actual
observation. There is no limit to the
number of facts with which statistics
have to do, provided they are co-existing
facts, and do not present
themselves in succession: facts, and
not their causes, are the proper matter
of statistics; and they must be facts
of the present time." This doctrine, in
which there seems nothing in the main
amiss, if strictly applied to the work under
consideration, cancels a large part
of it. But against that consequence we
can suppose it to be pleaded&mdash;First, that
for relief from a continuity of details
somewhat arid to many readers, the
work borrows something from a neighbouring
branch of knowledge, and so
far, of purpose, drops its statistical
character&mdash;the more allowably, as in
this way no harm ensues to the statistical
character of the rest. And
next&mdash;that all the history of a place
has not equally little to do with its present
state; for past events are often,
casually or otherwise, related to the
present, and so become a fair subject
of retrospect, unless restraints are to
be imposed on this branch of knowledge
which are unknown to any other.
The fault, in this instance, is at least
not so great, as where no discoverable
relation exists. It may be worth
while, then, to observe how far the
historical matter of the <cite>Statistical Account</cite>
does show any connexion of the
sort in question.</p>

<p>It includes, under the head of history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
various classes of particulars.
1. The parish has been the scene of
some event remarkable in the history
of the country. Of this, perhaps, distinct
traces remain, not in memory
alone, but in some local custom or
institution. But the most common
case is, that, as the range extends to
the remotest periods, all influence or
effect of the event has ceased, and the
interest of its recital is purely historical.
Here the <cite>Statistical Account</cite>
transgresses one rule of such a work
by the admission of such matter, and
asks, as we perceive it does ask in the
prospectus, liberty to do so on one of
the grounds above suggested.</p>

<p>2. The same apology is required
for the antiquities, that form a large
section under this head. These have
sometimes perceptibly the connexion
that gives the title we desire; a connexion,
perhaps, no more than perceptible.
Thus, in reference to the
round hill in the parish of Tarbolton,
on which the god Thor was anciently
worshipped, we are told that, "on the
evening before the June fair, a piece
of fuel is still demanded at each house,
and invariably given, even by the poorest
inhabitant," in order to celebrate
the form of the same superstitious rite
which has been annually performed on
that hill for many centuries. The
famous Pictish tower at Abernethy is
said to be used "for civil purposes
connected with the burgh." In these
cases it is seen how very slight is the
qualifying circumstance; but it is still
more so for much the greater number
of particulars of this kind which the
book contains&mdash;such as ancient coins,
ancient armour, barrows, standing-stones,
camps, or moat hills: all of
which particularly belong to archæology,
and obtain a place here simply by
favour. Indeed, no part of the work
adheres to it so loosely as this of antiquities.
Their objects live as curiosities;
but, to all intents that can
recommend them to the notice of statistics,
they are dead, "and to be so
extant is but a fallacy in duration."</p>

<p>If this portion of the matter be the
least appropriate, it is, at the same
time, not the least difficult to handle;
for uncertainty besets a very great
part of it, and nothing more tries the
reach of knowledge than conjecture.
Besides, the knowledge here requisite
implies both taste and opportunities
for its cultivation,&mdash;which may belong
to individuals, but which cannot
be attributed to an entire profession,
spread over all parts of the country,
and designated to very different
studies. If antiquities could be considered
as a main part of statistics,
it is, assuredly, not to the clergy
we should look for a statistical
account; nor indeed to any other
body, however learned, if it be not
the Society of Antiquaries. The
clergyman who honours his profession
with the greatest amount of appropriate
learning, may in this particular
know but little; and if we do not, on
that account, the less value him, it is
assuredly not from undervaluing in
the slightest degree a very interesting
branch of knowledge.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, the reasons
for allowing to antiquities so much of
this compilation appear to have been,&mdash;the
compelling example of the old Account,
the occasional aptness of the
matter, and the effect of such a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mélange</i>
upon the mass of details that form the
body of the work. But a better apology
remains; and it may be extended
to what is said of the remarkable
events of history. We are warranted
in saying, that the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite>
has contributed much to the
history and antiquities of Scotland,&mdash;evincing
on these subjects a frequent
novelty and fulness of knowledge far
surpassing what either the design or
the apparatus of the undertaking gave
any title to expect.</p>

<p>Of one fault, in particular, there
is no appearance in the archæology of
this work. Nowhere is there any
sign of an idiosyncracy which is not
without example&mdash;that of professing
to speak of statistics, and yet speaking
of nothing but antiquities; as if these,
which are saved with so much difficulty
from the charge of being wholly
out of place, were the pith and marrow,
the most vital part of any body
of statistics. This is a small merit,
but it is allied to a greater. Throughout
these volumes, there is no tendency
to discuss such futile questions
as have sometimes lowered the credit
of antiquarian pursuits. We have
seen it solemnly inquired, whether
Æneas, upon landing in Italy, touched
the soil with the right or with the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
foot foremost; whether Karl Haco
was in person present at the sacrifice
of his son; whether a faded inscription
upon the walls of an old church be of
this import or that&mdash;in either case the
interest having so little to support it
in the significance of the record that
it can scarce be imagined to exist at
all, except as it may centre in the
mere truth of the deciphering. Nothing
of this doting, degenerate character,
repudiated by all antiquaries,
occurs in the <cite>Statistical Account</cite>: if it
did, the sum of all the errors in names,
dates, and other things, inevitably incident
to so vast a variety of details,
would not have been an equal blemish.</p>

<p>It is probable that neither history
nor antiquities will find a place in any
future statistics of Scotland. Not that
they have been enough examined either
in that connexion, or elsewhere; but it
is now common to make them the subject
of separate, independent essays&mdash;the
most proper form for the delivery of
anything that pertains to such matters.
The good service done in this department,
by both of these Accounts, now
falls to be performed by such works as
the "Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities
of Scotland,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which have this
for their single object; and the presumption
is only fair, that some further
light on such matters may be contributed
by the "Parochiale Scoticanum,"
lately announced as in the
course of preparation<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;though our
expectations would not have been at
all lessened by a somewhat less magnificent
promise than that "every man
in Scotland may be enabled to ascertain,
with some precision, the first
footing and <em>gradual progress of Christianity</em>
in his own district and neighbourhood."</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed, however,
that some other topics which regularly
appear in this New Account, under the
head of history, will ever drop from
any work of parochial statistics. We
refer to what may be termed Parish
History, as distinct from what belongs
to the history of the country,&mdash;notices
of distinguished individuals and of
ancient families, changes of property,
territorial improvements, variations in
the social state of the people. No
part of a book is more novel, or, to a
proper curiosity, more interesting;
and no indication is needed of the fair
incidence of such matters to a work of
this description.</p>

<p>If the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite>
contains, then, some particulars not
quite proper to the professed object,
the excess appears to be on the whole
venial. But it may still be asked,
whether any important and proper
matters appear to have been omitted.</p>

<p>Now, considering how many things
of nature, art, institutions, and industry
pertain to statistics, we do
not expect any compilation to embrace
all, or to treat completely of all such
things as it does embrace,&mdash;we expect
imperfection in the details.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it is seen that some
subjects well described in some accounts,
are either not at all, or not so
fully, taken up in others; while yet
the occasion may be much the same.
The climate of some districts, for
instance, is well illustrated by careful
observations from the rain-gage and
thermometer; in some parishes we
are informed of the size of the agricultural
possessions, the number of
ploughs, the rent of land; in some,
manufactories, mines, and other kinds
of industry, are viewed in all their
aspects. But, for other districts or
parishes, reports on these subjects are
wanting; and the disadvantage is, not
merely that such desirable information
is not given for such places, but that
the means are not furnished of making
any general computations for the
whole country. It is plain there have
been special reasons for the less satisfactory
representation of particular
parishes in these respects: but for
all such faults, both of omission and
imperfection, we understand the <cite>New
Statistical Account</cite> to have one general
apology; which is this.</p>

<p>Two distinct efforts are requisite to
the preparation of a comprehensive
work of statistics. There is first, the
investigation of facts; and next, the
task of arranging and presenting them
in the report. One of the theorists
before-mentioned, views it as a necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
division of labour, that both
things should not be attempted by one
and the same party,&mdash;especially as the
first, when the subjects are numerous,
is not to be accomplished but by the
assistance of many hands&mdash;all of
which, as he observes, must be at
once skilful and suitably rewarded.
Now, here, the task of inquiring and
reporting was not divided; the whole
of it was placed, by the necessities of
the case, in the hands of the reverend
contributors. But, as no private
society had the means or authority to
investigate the facts completely, it is
urged that the defects to which we
have alluded, were for the most part
inevitable.</p>

<p>We believe it; and, recognising
how much the clergy had thus to do,
which could only be done completely
by the government, we only advert to
the sources of information to which
they could have recourse.</p>

<p><em>Public documents</em> seem to have been
consulted, when information of a later
date could not be had,&mdash;and chiefly
the parliamentary reports on population,
crime, education, and municipal
affairs, from which the parish accounts
appear to have been supplemented
with whatever was necessary to the
completion of the county summaries.
Much has also been derived from the
reports of Societies, Boards, and mercantile
companies; of this there is
evidence in the account of every considerable
town.</p>

<p><em>Public records</em> appear also to have
been examined, and chiefly the parish
registers. Every parish has a record
of the transactions of its kirk-session,&mdash;sometimes
extending to distant
periods. Extracts from these occasionally
show, in a clear light, the
state and manners of the country in
former times; more of which authentic
illustration we could have wished,
and more the same sources might
possibly have supplied. Most parishes
have also records of births or
baptisms, marriages and deaths.
From these, and these only, this
work could derive the elements of its
important section of vital statistics;
but how far were they fitted to serve
that purpose? It is certain that
they nowhere form a complete register
of these occurrences, and
that for the most part they are
very defective. Baptisms appear to
have been entered, in the parish register,
regularly till the year 1783,
when the imposition of a small tax
first broke the custom of registration;
and, when that tax was removed,
dissenting bodies were unwilling to
resume the practice. The proportion
of registered baptisms to births, for
instance, is at the present time not
more than one fourth in Edinburgh,
and one third in Glasgow. The
marriage register is also unavailable
to statistical purposes, by reason of
the practice of double enrolment&mdash;in
the parish of each party. In many
parishes no record of burials exists:
in others, those of paupers are omitted.
In short, there is scarcely a country
in Europe that does not, by proper
arrangements, furnish better information
on these important points; and
no industry of individuals can remedy
that defect. It is therefore among
the postulates of a work like this,
for Scotland, that its vital statistics
should be imperfect.</p>

<p><em>Books</em> relating to the history, civil
or natural, the institutions or manners
of the country, have in many instances
been well consulted; in some, not at
all; but probably as much from want
of opportunity as from any other
cause.</p>

<p>Still much occasion for inquiry remained
after all the use that could be
made of reports, registers, and books.
Much of what related to the institutions
of Religion, education, and the
poor, might be supposed to come
readily to hand, the clergy themselves
being most conversant with such
matters. But they appear to have
charged themselves with the toil of
very different investigations. Some
have been at the pains to ascertain
the amount and occupations of the
population, betwixt the decennial
terms of the parliamentary census.
Few have omitted to state, in connexion
with the agriculture of the
parish, the quantities of land under
tillage or under wood, in pasture or
in moor, and the amount respectively
of the different kinds of produce&mdash;facts
that imply not a little correspondence
with land-owners and land-occupiers,
and much industry in the collation of
returns. They have had recourse, frequently,
to mineralogists, botanists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
overseers of mining and manufacturing
works, whose contributions are of as
much value as the fullest and ripest
knowledge can give. Picture-galleries
are sometimes described by their
owners; family papers occasionally
disclose facts of some interest in
the history of the country. Throughout
the work there are signs not to be
mistaken, of much private and unwonted
inquiry on the part of the
reverend authors, to do, in a creditable
way, a work that, from the
nature of it, ought to have been
apportioned to at least two different
parties.</p>

<p>The defects which remain only
suggest to us the hope which was
thus expressed in similar circumstances,
that "the circulation of this
work, by bringing the deficiencies
in the means of statistical information
under the public view, and
drawing attention to them, may,
in this respect, also contribute to the
advancement of the science." It is
implied, of course, that the work, to
be useful in this indirect way, must
have merits of another kind. On
these the <cite>New Statistical Account</cite> may
stand. No other book affords the
same insight into the various natural
resources of the country; none describes
so well, and so skilfully, the
most considerable branches of industry,
and the methods of conducting
them; none has brought together the
same variety of statistics, with the
same ample means of speculating upon
their mutual relations. It is still
more remarkable, that such a work,
embracing, as it does, so much beyond
the usual sphere of their observation,
should proceed from the clergy; but
the explanation is, that the position
and character of that body open to
them the best means of information
on many subjects with which they are
themselves not at all conversant.
They have produced here a work,
which, as a collection of parochial
statistics, stands alone, without
either rival or resemblance in any
other country, representing the state
of Scotland, at the period to which
it refers, in all its aspects, and so
affording the means of a definite
comparison between the past and the
present, such as, in all cases, it is
at once natural and profitable to
make. A peculiar interest arises from
the unusual diversity of the matter,
and the familiarity of the writers with
the bounds which they describe. It
is a useful work, and will continue
long to be so, in as many ways as it
throws light upon the condition of the
country&mdash;and, not least, in the local
improvements to which its suggestions
may give rise. But, if its uses were less
than they are, it would still leave an
impression of respect for the general
intelligence and the readiness to employ
their opportunities for the public
good, which its authors have known
to unite with exemplary devotion to
the duties of their calling.</p>

<h2>THE POETRY OF SACRED AND LEGENDARY ART.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>The Poetry of Sacred and Legendary Art.</cite> By Mrs <span class="smcap">Jameson</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are of the belief that art without
poetry is worthless&mdash;dead, and
deadening; or, if it have vitality,
there is no music in its speech&mdash;no
command in its beauty. We treat it
with a kind of contempt, and make
apology for the pleasure it has afforded.
<cite>Sacred and Legendary Art!</cite>
How different&mdash;how precious&mdash;how
life-bestowing! The material and immaterial
world linked, as it were, together
by a new sympathy, working
out a tissue of beautiful ideas from the
golden threads of a Divine revelation!
By <cite>Sacred and Legendary Art</cite> is
meant the treatment of religions subjects,
commencing with the Old Testament,
and terminating in traditionary
tales and legends. It is from the
latter that the old painters have, for
the most part, taken that rich poetry,
which, glowing on the canvass, shows,
even amidst the wild errors of fable, a
truth of sentiment belonging to a
purer faith.</p>

<p>By the Protestant mind, nursed,
perhaps, in an undue contempt of histories
of saints and martyrs of the
Romish Church, the treasures of art
of the best period are rarely understood,
and still more rarely felt, in the
spirit in which they were conceived.
Those for whom they were painted
needed no cold inquiry into the subjects.
They accepted them as things
universally known and religiously to
be received, with a veneration which
we but little comprehend. With them
pictures and statues were among their
sacred things, and, together with
architecture, spoke and taught with
an authority that books, which then
were rare in the people's hands, have
since scarcely ever obtained. Men of
genius felt this respect paid to their
works, if denied too often to themselves;
and thus to their own devotion
was added a kind of ministerial
importance. Their work became a
duty, and was very frequently prosecuted
as such by the inmates of monasteries.
Besides their works on a
large scale, upon the walls and in their
cloisters, the ornamenting and illustrating
missals embodied a religious
feeling, if in some degree peculiar to
the condition of the workers, of a vital
form and beauty. Treasures of this
kind there are beyond number; but
they have been hidden treasures for
ages. A Protestant contempt for their
legends has persecuted, with long hatred,
and subsequent long indifference,
the art which glorified them. And now
that we awake from this dull state, and
begin to estimate the poetry of religious
art, we stand before the noblest
productions amazed and ignorant, and
looking for interpreters, and lose the
opportunity of enjoyment in the inquiry.
Art is too valuable for all it
gives, to allow this entire ignorance
of the subjects of its favourite treatment.
If, for the better understanding
of heathen art, an acquaintance with
classical literature is thought to be a
worthy attainment, the excellence of
what we may term Christian art surely
renders it of importance that we should
know something about the subjects of
which it treats. The inquiry will repay
us also in other respects, as well as
with regard to taste. If we would
know ourselves, it is well to see the
workings of the human mind, under its
every phase, its every condition. And
in such a study we shall be gratified,
perhaps unexpectedly, to find the good
and the beautiful still shining through
the obscurity of many errors, predominant
and influential upon our own
hearts, and scarcely wish the fabulous
altogether removed from the minds of
those who receive it in devotion, lest
great truth in feeling be removed also.
Indeed, the legends themselves are
mostly harmless, and, even as they
become discredited, may be interpreted
as not unprofitable allegories. Had
we not, in a Puritanic zeal, discarded
art with an iconoclast persecution,
<cite>The Pilgrim's Progress</cite> had long ere
this been a "golden legend" for the
people, and spoken to them in worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
illustration; nor would they have
been religiously or morally the worse
had they been imbued with a thorough
taste for the graceful, the beautiful,
and the sublime, which it is in the
power of well cultivated art to convey
to every willing recipient. It is a great
mistake of a portion of the religious
world to look upon ornament as a sin
or a superstition. Religion is not a
bare and unadorned thing, nor can it
be so received without debasing, without
making too low and mean the worshipper
for the worship. The "wedding
garment" was not the every-day
wear. The poorest must not, of a
choice, appear in rags before the throne
of Him who is clothed in glory, nor
with less respect of their own person
than they would use in the presence of
their betters. It was originally of
God's doing, command, and dictation,
to sanctify the beautiful in art, by
making his worship a subject for all
embellishment. For such a purport
were the minute directions for the
building of His temple. And yet how
many "religious" of our day contradict
this feeling, which seems to come
to us, not only by a natural instinct,
but with the authority of a command!
It is a deteriorated worship that prefers
four bare, unadorned, whitened
walls of a mean conventicle to the
lofty and arched majesty and profuse
enrichment of a Gothic minster. We
want every aid to lift every sense
above our daily grovelling cares, and
ought to feel that we are acceptable
and invited guests in a house far too
great, spacious, and magnificent for
ourselves alone. Even our humility
should be sublime, as all true worship
is, for we would fain lift it up as an
offering to the Heaven of heavens. It
has its aspect towards Him who deigns
to receive, together with consciousness
of the lowliness of him that offers.
It is good that the eye and the ear
should see and hear other sounds and
sights than concern things, not only of
time, but of that poor portion of it
which hems in our daily wants and
businesses. Beauty and music are of
and for eternity, and will never die;
and in our perception of them we
make ourselves a part of all that is
undying. These are senses that the
spiritualised body will not lose. Their
cultivation is a thing for ever; we
are now even here the greater for
their possession in their human perfection.
The wondrous pile so elaborately
finished; the choral service,
the pealing organ, and the low
voice of prayer, and, it may be, angel
forms and beatified saints in richly-painted
windows:&mdash;we do not believe
all this to be solely of man's invention,
but of inspiration; how given we
ask not, seeing what is, and acknowledging
a greatness around us far
greater than ourselves, and lifting up
the full mind to a magnitude emulous
of angelic stature. Yes&mdash;poetic genius
is a high gift, by which the gifted
make discoveries, and show high and
great truths, and present them, palpable
and visible, before the world&mdash;by
architecture, by painting, by sculpture,
by music&mdash;rendering religion itself
more holy by the inspiration
of its service. Take a man out of
his common, so to speak, irreverent
habit, and place him here to live for
a few moments in this religious atmosphere&mdash;how
unlike is he to himself,
and how conscious of this self-unlikeness!
Would that our cathedrals were
open at all times! Even when there
is no service, though that might be
more frequent, there would be much
good communing with a man's own
heart, when, turning away for a while
from worldly troubles and speculations,
in midst of that great solemn monument,
erected to his Maker's praise,
and with the dead under his feet&mdash;the
dead who as busily walked the streets
and ways he has just left&mdash;he would
weigh the character of his doings,
and in a sanctified place breathe a
prayer for direction. Nor would it
be amiss that he should be led to contemplate
the "storied pane" and religious
emblems which abound; he will
not fail, in the end, to sympathise with
the sentiment even where he bows not
to the legend. He may know the fact
that there have been saints and martyrs&mdash;that
faith, hope, and charity
are realities&mdash;that patience and love
may be here best learnt to be practised
in the world without.</p>

<p>It is curious that the saints, those
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii minores</i>, to whom so many of our
churches are dedicated, still retain
their holding. Beyond the evangelists
and the apostles, little do the
people know of the other many saints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
while they enter the churches that
bear their names. Few of a congregation,
we suspect, could give much
account of St Pancras, St Margaret,
St Werburgh, St Dunstan, St Clement,
nor even of St George, but that
he is pictured slaying a dragon, and is
the patron saint of England. Yet
were they once "household gods" in
the land. It is a curious speculation
this of patron saints, and how every
family and person had his own. There
is a great fondness in this old personal
attachment of his own angel to every
man. That notion preceded Christianity,
and was easily engrafted upon
it: and the angel that attended from
the birth was but supplanted by some
holy dead whom the Church canonised.
And a corrupt church humoured the
superstition, and attached miracles to
relics; and thus, as of old, these came,
in latter times, to be "gods many."
And what were these but over again
the thirty thousand deities who, Hesiod
said, inhabited the earth, and
were guardians of men? Yet, it must
be confessed, there has been a popular
purification of them. They are not
the panders to vice that infested the
morals of the heathen world.</p>

<p>But how came the heathen world
by them? Did they invent, or where
find them? And how came their characteristics
to be so universal, in all
countries differing rather in name than
personality? The most intellectually-gifted
people under the sun, the ancient
Greeks, give nowhere any rational
account how they came by the gods
they worshipped. They take them
as personifications from their poets.
There is the theogony of Hesiod, and
the gods as Homer paints them. They
have called forth the glory of art; and
wonderful were the periods that
stamped on earth their statues, as
if all men's intellect had been
tasked to the work, that they should
leave a mark and memorial of beauty
than which no age hereafter should
show a greater. We acknowledge the
perfection in the remains that are
left to us. Greek art stills sways the
mind of every country&mdash;all the world
mistrusts every attempt in a contrary
direction. The excellence of Greek
sculpture is reflected back again upon
Greek fable, the heathen mythology
from which it was taken; and perhaps
a greater partiality is bestowed upon
that than it deserves,&mdash;at least, we may
say so in comparison with any other.
We must be cautious how we take the
excellence of art for the excellence of
its subject. The Greeks were formed
for art beyond every other people; had
their creed been hideous&mdash;and indeed
it was obscene&mdash;they would have
adorned it with every beauty of ideal
form. And this is worthy of note
here, that their poetry in art was infinitely
more beautiful than their
written poetry. Their sculptors, and
perhaps their painters, of whom we
are not entitled to speak but by conjecture,
and from the opinions formed
by no bad judges of their day, did aim
at the portraying a kind of divine
humanity. If their sculptured deities
have not a holy repose, they are singularly
freed from display of human
passions; whereas, in their poetry, it is
rarely that even decent repose is
allowed them; they are generally too
active, without dignity, and without
respect to the moral code of a not
very scrupulous age. Yet have these
very heathen gods, even as their historians
the poets paint them&mdash;for it
would disgrace them to speak of their
biographers&mdash;a trace of a better origin
than we can gather out of the whimsical
theogony. There are some particulars
in the heathen mythology that
point to a visible track in the strange
road of history. Much we know was
had from Egypt; more, probably, came
with the Cadmean letters from
Ph&oelig;nicia&mdash;a name including Palestine
itself. Inventions went only to corruptions&mdash;the
original of all creeds of
divinity is from revelation. We may
not be required to point out the direct
road nor the resting-places of this
"<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">santa casa</i>," holding all the gods of
Greece, so beautiful in their personal
portraiture, that we love to gaze with
the feeling of Schiller, though their
histories will not bear the scrutiny:
but it will suffice to note some similitudes
that cannot be accidental.
Somehow or other, both the historic
and prophetic writings of the Bible,
or narratives from them, had reached
Greece as well as other distant lands.
The Greeks had, at a very early period,
embodied in their myths even the personal
characters as shown in those
writings. Let us, for example, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
referring to their Zeus in a particular
manner, find in the Hermes or
Mercury of the Greeks the identity
with Moses. What are the characteristics
of both? If Moses descended
from the Mount with the commands
of God, and was emphatically God's
messenger, so was Hermes the messenger
from Olympus: his chief office
was that of messenger. If Moses is
known as the slayer of the Egyptian,
so is Hermes, (and so is he more frequently
called in Homer,) Αργειφοντης,
the slayer of Argus, the overseer of a
hundred eyes. Moses conducted
through the wilderness to the Jordan
those who died and reached not the
promised land; nor did he pass the
Jordan. So was Hermes the conductor of
the dead, delivering them
over to Charon, (and here note the
resemblance of name with Aaron, the
associate of Moses); nor was he to
pass to the Elysian fields.</p>

<p>Then the rod, the serpents,&mdash;the
Caduceus of Hermes, with the serpents
twining round the rod. The
appearance of Moses, and the shining
from his head, as it is commonly
figured, is again represented in the
winged cap of Hermes. There are
other minute circumstances, especially
some noted in the hymn of Hermes,
ascribed to Homer, which we forbear
to enumerate, thinking the coincidences
already mentioned are sufficiently
striking.</p>

<p>Then, again, the idea of the serpent
of the Greek mythology, whence
did it come, and the slaying of it by
the son of Zeus&mdash;and its very name,
the Python, the serpent of corruption?
And in that sense it has been carried
down to this day as an emblem in
Christian art. But, to go back a
moment, this departure of the Israelites
from Egypt, is there no notice of
it in Homer? We think there is a
hint which indicates a knowledge of
at least a part of that history&mdash;the
previous slavery, the being put to
work, and the after-readiness of the
Egyptians to be "spoiled." Ulysses,
giving a false account of himself, if
we remember rightly, to Eumæus,
says he came from Egypt, where he
had been a merchant, that the king
of that country seized him and all his
men, whom <em>he put to work</em>, but that
at length he found favour, and was
allowed to depart with his people;
adding that he collected much property
from the people of Egypt, "for all of
them gave."</p>

</div></div>

<p>We do not mean to lay any great stress
upon this quotation, and but think at
least that it shows a characteristic of
the Egyptians as narrated by Moses;
and never having met with any allusion
to it, nor indeed to our parallel between
Moses and Hermes, which it may seem
to support, we have thought it worthy
this brief notice.</p>

<p>We fancy we trace the history of
the cause of the fall of man, in the
eating of the pomegranate seed which
doomed Proserpine to half an existence
in the infernal regions. Can
there be anything more striking than
the Prometheus Bound of Æschylus?
Whence could such a notion come,
that a man-god would, for his love to
mankind, (for bringing down fire from
heaven,) suffer agonies, nailed not
upon a cross indeed, but on a rock,
and, in the description, crucified? "It
is, after a manner," says Mr Swayne,
who has with great power translated
this strange play of Æschylus, "a
Christian poem by a pagan author,
foreshadowing the opposition and reconciliation
of Divine justice and Divine
love. Whence the sublime conception
of the subject of this drama could
have been obtained, it is useless to
speculate. Some even suppose that
its author must have been acquainted
with the old Hebrew prophets."</p>

<p>Even the introduction of Io in the
tale is suggestive&mdash;the virgin-mother
who was so strangely to conceive
(and this too given in a prophecy)
miraculously.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jove at length shall give thee back thy mind,<br /></span>

<p>Then again Sampson passes into the
Egyptian or Tyrian Hercules, to lose
his life by another Delilah in Dejaneira.
Whence the prophetic Sybils, whence
and what the Eleusinian mysteries?
and that strange glimpse of them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the significant passage of the Alcestis,
where the restored from the dead must
abstain from speech till the third day&mdash;the
duration of her consecration to
Hades!</p>

</div></div>

<p>We might enter largely into the
mysteries of heathen mythology, and
discover strange coincidences and resemblances,
but it would take us too
wide from our present subject. Our
present purpose is to show that we
are apt to attribute too much to the
Grecian fable, when we ascribe to it
all the beauty which Grecian art has
elaborated from it. For, in fact, the
origin of that fabulous poetry is beyond
them in far-off time; and by
them how corrupted, shorn of its real
grandeur, and at once magnificent
and lovely beauty! How much more,
then, is it ours than theirs, as it is deducible
from that high revelation
which is part of the Christian religion.
We overlook, in the excellence
of Grecian art, the far better
materials for all art, which we in our
religion possess, and have ever possessed.
With the Greeks it was an
instinct to love the beautiful, sensual
and intellectual: it was a part of their
nature to discover it or to create it.
They would have fabricated it out of
any materials; and deteriorated, indeed,
were those which came to their
hands. And even this excess of their
love, at least in their poets, made the
sensuous to overcome the intellectual;
but the far higher than intellectual&mdash;the
celestial, the spiritual&mdash;they had
not: their highest reach in the moral
sense was a sublime pride: they had
no conception of a sublime humility.
Their highest divinity was how much
lower than the lowest order of angels
that wait around the heavenly throne
and adore,&mdash;low as is their Olympus,
where they placed their Zeus and all
his band, to the Christian "heaven
of heavens," which yet cannot contain
the universal Maker. It is bad taste,
indeed, in us, as some do, to give them
the palm of the possession of a better
field&mdash;poetic field for the exercise of
art. "Christian and Legendary art"
has a principle which no other art
could have, and which theirs certainly
had not; they were sensuous from a
necessity of their nature, lacking this
principle. We ought to ascribe all
which they have left us to their skill,
their genius: wonderful it was, and
wonderful things did it perform; but,
after all, we admire more than we
love. Their divine was but a grand
and stern repose; their loveliness, but
the perfection of the human form.
And so great were they in this their
genius, that the monuments of heathen
art are beyond the heathen creed;
for in those the unsensuous prevailed.</p>

<p>Let us suppose the gift of their genius
to have been delayed to the Christian
era&mdash;as poetical subjects, their
whole mythology would have been set
aside for a far better adoption; and
we should be now universally acknowledging
how lovely and how great, how
full and bountiful, for poetry and for
art, are the ever-flowing fountains,
gushing in life, giving exuberance
from that high mount, to the sight of
which Pindus cannot lift its head, nor
show its poor Castalian rills. The
"gods of Greece," the far-famed
"gods of Greece," what are they to
the hierarchy of heaven&mdash;angels and
archangels, and all the host&mdash;powers,
dominions, hailing the admission to
the blissful regions of saints spiritualised,
and after death to die no more&mdash;glorified?
What loveliness is like
that of throned chastity? Graces and
Muses in their perfectness of marbled
beauty&mdash;what are they to faith, hope,
and charity, and the veiled virtues
that like our angels shroud themselves?
When these became subjects for our
Christian art, then was true expression
first invented in drapery. "Christian
and legendary art" is not denied the
nude; but no other has so made
drapery a living, speaking poetry.
There is a dignity, a grace, a sweetness,
in the drapery of mediæval
sculpture, that equally commands our
admiration, and more our reverence
and our love, than ancient statues,
draped or nude. And this is the expression
of Scripture poetry&mdash;the represented
language, the "clothing
with power," the "garment of
righteousness." We often loiter about
our old cathedrals, and look up with
wonder at the mutilated remains as a
new type of beauty, beaming through
the obscurity of the so-called dark
ages. Lovers of art, as we profess to
be, in all its forms, we profess without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hesitation that we would not exchange
these&mdash;that is, lose them as
never to have existed&mdash;for all that
Grecian art has left us. Even now,
what power have we to restore these
specimens of expressive workmanship,
broken and mutilated as they have been
by a low and misbegotten zeal? We
maintain further, generally, that the
works of "Christian and legendary
art," in painting, sculpture, and architecture,
are as infinitely superior to
the works of all Grecian antiquity, as is
the source of their inspiration higher
and purer: we are, too, astonished at
the perfect agreement of the one with
the other, showing one mind, one
spirit&mdash;devotion. We strongly insist
upon this, that there has been a far
higher character and equal power in
Christian art compared with heathen.
It ought to be so, and it is so. It has
been too long set aside in the world's
opinion (often temporary and ill-formed)
to establish the inferior.
This country, in particular, has yielded
a cold neglect of these beautiful things,
in shameful and indolent compliance
with the mean, tasteless, degrading
Puritanism, that mutilated and would
have destroyed them utterly if it
could, as it would have treated every
and all the beautiful.</p>

<p>Even at the first rise of this Christian
art, the superiority of the principle
which moved the artists was visible
through their defect of knowledge
of art, as art. The devotional spirit
is evident; a sense of purity, that
spiritualised humanity with its heavenly
brightness, dims the imperfections
of style, casting out of observation
minor and uncouth parts. Often,
in the incongruous presence of things
vulgar in detail of habit and manners,
an angelic sentiment stands embodied,
pure and untouched, as if the artist,
when he came to that, felt holy ground,
and took his shoes from off his feet.
It was not long before the art was
equal to the whole work. There are
productions of even an early time
that are yet unequalled, and, for
power over the heart and the judgment,
are much above comparison with any
preceding works of boasted antiquity.</p>

<p>Take only the full embodying of all
angelic nature: what is there like to
it out of Christian art? How unlike
the cold personifications of "Victories"
winged,&mdash;though even these
were borrowed,&mdash;are the ministering
and adoring angels of our art&mdash;now
bringing celestial paradise down to
saints on earth, and now accompanying
them, and worshipping with them,
in their upward way, amid the receding
and glorious clouds of heaven!
Look at the sepulchral monuments of
Grecian art&mdash;the frigid mysteries, the
abhorrent ghost, yet too corporeal,
shrinking from Lethé; and the dismal
boat&mdash;the unpromising, unpitying
aspect of Charon: then turn to some
of the sublime Christian monuments
of art, that speak so differently of
that death&mdash;the Coronation of the
Virgin, the Ascension of Saints. The
dismal and the doleful earth has
vanished&mdash;choirs of angels rush to
welcome and to support the beatified,
the released: death is no more, but
life breathing no atmosphere of earth,
but all freshness, and all joy, and all
music; the now changed body glowing,
like an increasing light, into its
spirituality of form and beauty, and
thrilling with</p>

</div></div>

<p class="noind">Then shall we doubt, and not dare to
pronounce the superior capabilities of
Christian art, arising out of its subject&mdash;poetry?
We prefer, as a great poetic
conception, Raffaelle's Archangel,
Michael, with his victorious foot upon
his prostrate adversary, to the far-famed
Apollo Belvidere, who has
slain his Python; and his St Margaret,
in her sweet, her innocent, and clothed
grace, to that perfect model of woman's
form, the Venus de Medici.
Not that we venture a careless or
misgiving thought of the perfectness
of those great antique works: their
perfectness was according to their
purpose. Higher purposes make a
higher perfectness. Nor would we
have them viewed irreverently; for
even in them, and the genius that
produced them, the Creator, as in
"times past, left not Himself without
witness." In showing forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the glory of the human form, they
show forth the glory of Him who
made it&mdash;who is thus glorified in the
witnesses; and so we accept and love
them. But to a certain degree they
must stand dethroned&mdash;their influence
faded. Lowly unassuming virtues&mdash;virtues
of the soul, far greater
in their humility, in the sacred poetry
of our Christian faith, shine like
stars, even in their smallness, on the
dark night of our humanity; and they
are to take their places in the celestial
of art; and we feel that it is His will,
who, as the hymn of the blessed
Virgin&mdash;that type of all these united
virtues&mdash;declares, "hath put down
the mighty from their seat, and hath
exalted the humble and meek."</p>

<p>We trust yet to see sacred art
resumed; for the more we consider
its poetry, the more inexhaustible
appears the mine. Nor do we require
to search and gather in the field of
fabulous legends; though in a poetic
view, and for their intention, and resumed
merely as a fabulous allegory,
they are not to be set aside. But
sure we are that, whatever can move
the heart, can excite to the greatest
degree our pity, our love, or convey
the greatest delight through scenes
for which the term beautiful is but a
poor describer, and personages for
whose magnificence languages have
no name&mdash;all is within the volume
and the history of our suffering and
triumphant religion.</p>

<p>Would that we could stir but one
of our painters to this, which should
be his great business! Genius is
bestowed for no selfish gratification,
but for service, and for a "witness,"
to bear which let the gifted offer only
a willing heart, and his lamp will not
be suffered to go out for lack of oil.
Why is the tenderness of Mr Eastlake's
pencil in abeyance? That
portion of the sacred history which
commences with his "Christ weeping
over Jerusalem," might well be continued
in a series. Even still more
power has he shown in the creative
and symbolic, as exemplified in his
poetic conception of Virtue from
Milton&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She can teach you how to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Higher than the sphery chime;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or if Virtue feeble were,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heaven itself would stoop to her."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If we believe genius to be an inspiring
spirit, we may contemplate it
hereafter as an accusing angel. With
such a paradise of subjects before
them, why do so many of our painters
run to the kennel and the stable, or
plunge their pencils into the gaudy
hues of meretricious enticement? We
do verily believe that the world is
waiting for better things. It is taking
a greater interest in higher subjects,
and those of a pure sentiment. It is
that our artists are behind the feeling,
and not, as they should be, in the advance.
It is a great fact that there
is such a growing feeling. The resumption
of sacred art in Germany is
not without its effect, and is making
its way here in prints. Most of these
are from the Aller Heiligen Kapelle
at Munich, the result of the taste of
at least one crowned head in Europe,
who, with more limited means and
power, has set an example of a better
patronage, which would have well
become Courts of greater splendour,
and more imperial influence. Must
it be asked what our own artists&mdash;the
Academy, with all its staff&mdash;are
doing?</p>

<p>We must stay our hand; for we
took up the pen to notice the two
volumes just published of Mrs Jameson's
<cite>Sacred and Legendary Art</cite>.
They have excited, in the reading, an
enthusiastic pleasure, and led the
fancy wandering in the delightful
fields sanctified by heavenly sunshine,
and trod by sainted feet; and, like a
traveller in a desert, having found an
oasis, we feel loath to leave it, and
would fain linger and drink again of
its refreshing springs. These volumes
have reached us most seasonably, at a
period of the year when the mind is
more especially directed to contemplate
the main subjects of which they
treat, and to anticipate only by days
the vision of joy and glory which will
be scripturally put before us&mdash;to see
the Virgin Mother and the Holy
Babe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And all about the courtly stable,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bright harness'd angels sit in order serviceable."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs Jameson disclaims in this
work any other object than the poetry
of Sacred and Legendary Art; and to
enable those who are, or wish to be,
conversant with the innumerable
productions of Italian and other
schools, in an artistic view, likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
at once to know the subjects
upon which they treat. Even as a
handbook, therefore, these volumes
are valuable. Much of the early
painting was symbolical. Ignorance
of the symbols rejects the sentiment,
or at least the intention, and at the
same time makes what is only quaint
appear absurd.</p>

<p>"The first volume contains the legends
of the Scripture personages, and
the primitive fathers. The second
volume contains those sainted personages
who lived, or are supposed to
have lived, in the first ages of Christianity,
and whose real history,
founded on fact or tradition, has been
so disguised by poetical embroidery,
that they have in some sort the air of
ideal beings." Possibly this poetical
disguise is favourable upon the whole
to art, but it renders a key necessary,
and that Mrs Jameson has supplied&mdash;not
pretending, however, to more than
a selection of the most interesting;
and, what is extremely valuable, there
are marginal references to pictures,
and in what places they are to be met
with, and by whom painted, of the
subjects given in the text, and of the
view the artists had in so painting
them. The emblems are amply noted
with their meanings; and even the
significance of colours, which has been
so commonly overlooked, and is yet so
important for the comprehension of
the full subject of a picture, is clearly
laid down. It is well said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All the productions of art, from the
time it has been directed and developed
by the Christian influences, may be regarded
under three different aspects:&mdash;1st,
The purely religious aspect, which
belongs to one mode of faith; 2d, The
poetical aspect, which belongs to all;
3d, The artistic, which is the individual
point of view, and has reference only to
the action of the intellect on the means
and material employed. There is a pleasure,
an intense pleasure, merely in the
consideration of art, as art; in the faculties
of comparison and nice discrimination
brought to bear on objects of beauty;
in the exercise of a cultivated and refined
taste on the productions of mind in any
form whatever. But a threefold, or rather
a thousandfold, pleasure is theirs,
who to a sense of the poetical unite a
sympathy with the spiritual in art, and
who combine with a delicacy of perception
and technical knowledge, more elevated
sources of pleasure, more variety of
association, habits of more excursive
thought. Let none imagine, however,
that in placing before the uninitiated
these unpretending volumes, I assume any
such superiority as is here implied. Like
a child that has sprang on a little way
before its playmates, and caught a glimpse
through an opening portal of some varied
Eden within, all gay with flowers, and
musical with birds, and haunted by divine
shapes which beckon forward, and,
after one rapturous survey, runs back and
catches its companions by the hand, and
hurries them forwards to share the new-found
pleasure, the yet unexplored region
of delight: even so it is with me: I am on
the outside, not the inside, of the door I
open."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a happy introduction to that
which immediately follows of angels
and archangels.</p>

<p>Mrs Jameson has so managed to
open the door as to frame in her subject
to the best advantage; and the
reader is willing to stand for a moment
with her to gaze upon the inward
brightness of the garden, ere he ventures
in to see what is around and
what is above. It is on the first
downward step that we stand breathless
with Aladdin, and feel the influence
of the first&mdash;the partial and
framed-in picture&mdash;glowing in the unearthly
illumination of its magical
creation.</p>

<p>There is nothing more interesting
than these few pages upon angels.
The information we receive is very
curious. It is beautiful poetry to see
orders, and degrees, and ministrations
various, types of an embodied, a ministering
church here, and ordained,
together with the saints of earth,
to make one glorified triumphant
church hereafter. Without entering
upon the theological question, as to
the extension and mystification of the
ideas of angels after the Captivity,
(yet we think it might be shown that
there was originally no Chaldaic belief
on the subject not taken, first or last,
from the Jews themselves,) it may
not be unworthy of remark, that the
word "angel," signifying messenger,
could scarcely with propriety have
been at the first applied to Satan, the
deceiving serpent, until, in the after-development
of the history of the
human race, the ministering offices
gave the general title, which, when
established, included all who had not
"kept their first estate." Nor do we
think, with Mrs Jameson, that Chaldea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
had anything to do with the introduction
of the worship of angels into
the Christian church. The "gods
many" of the heathen countries in
which Christianity established itself,
will sufficiently account for the readiness
of the people to transfer the multifarious
worship to which they had
been accustomed to names more suitable
to the new religion. It is with
the poetical development we have
here to do; and what ground is there
for that full development in the New
Testament, wherein they are represented
as "countless&mdash;as superior to all
human wants and weaknesses&mdash;as deputed
messengers of God? They rejoice
over the repentant sinner; they
take deep interest in the mission of
Christ; they are present with those
who pray; they bear the souls of the just
to heaven; they minister to Christ
on earth, and will be present at his
second coming." From such authority,
from such a sacred theatre of
scenes and celestial personages, arose
the beautiful, the magnificent visions
of the workers of sacred art. Heresy,
however, reached it, as might have
been expected; and the agency of
angels, in the creation of the world and
of man, has been represented, to the
deterioration of its great poetry.
From the beginning of the fourteenth
century, a great change seems to have
taken place in the representation of
the angel with reference to the Virgin:
the feeling is changed; "the veneration
paid to the Virgin demanded
another treatment. She becomes not
merely the principal person, but the
superior being; she is the 'regina
angelorum,' and the angel bows to
her, or kneels before her, as to a
queen. Thus, in the famous altar-piece
at Cologne, the angel kneels;
he bears the sceptre, and also a sealed
roll, as if he were a celestial ambassador
delivering his credentials. About
the same period we sometimes see the
angel merely with his hands folded
over his breast, and his head inclined,
delivering his message as if to a superior
being."</p>

<p>It is a great merit in this work of
Mrs Jameson's, that we are not only
referred to the most curious and to
the best specimens of art, but have
likewise beautiful woodcuts, and
some etchings admirably executed by
Mrs Jameson's own hand in illustration.
There is a greatness in the
simplicity of Blake's angels: "The
morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy."
Poor Blake! Yet why say poor? he
was happy in his visions&mdash;a little before
his time, and one of whom the
world (of art) in his day were not
worthy: though, with a wild extravagance
of fancy, his creations were
his faith, often great, and always
gentle. Exquisitely beautiful are the
"angels of the planets" from Raffaelle,
and copied by Mrs Jameson from
Gruner's engravings of the frescoes
of the Capella Chigiana. That great
painter of mystery, Rembrandt, whom
the mere lovers of form would have
mistakenly thought it a profanation to
commission with an angelic subject, is
justly appreciated. A perfect master
of light, and of darkness, and of colour,
it mattered not what were the
forms, so that they were unearthly,
that plunged into or broke through
his luminous or opaque. Of the picture
in the Louvre it is thus remarked:
"Miraculous for true and
spirited expression, and for the action
of the soaring angel, who parts the
clouds and strikes through the air like
a strong swimmer through the waves
of the sea." Strange&mdash;but so it is&mdash;we
cannot conceive an alteration of
his pictures, all parts so agree. Attention
to the more beautiful in form
would have appeared to him a mistrust
in his great gift of colour and
chiaroscuro; and, stranger still, that
without, and seemingly in a marked
defiance of mere beauty, he is, we
would almost say never, vulgar, never
misses the intended sentiment, nor
fails where it is of tenderness, even of
feminine tenderness, for which, if he
does not give beauty, he gives its
equivalent in the fulness of the feeling.
We instance his Salutation&mdash;Elizabeth
and the Virgin Mary. There is
something terrifically grand in the
crouching angel in the Campo Santo,&mdash;not
in the form, nor in the face, which
is mostly hid, but in the conception of
the attitude of horror with which he
beholds the awful scene. It is from
the Last Judgment of Orcagua in
the Campo Santo. We must not
speak of Rubens as a painter of angels;
and, for real angelic expression,
perhaps the earlier painters are the
best. It is surprising that Mrs Jameson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
from whose refined taste, and
from whose sense of the beautiful
and the graceful in their highest qualities,
we should have expected another
judgment, could have ventured to
name together Raffaelle and Murillo
as angel painters. It is true, in speaking
of the Visit to Abraham, she
admits that the painter has set aside
the angelic and mystic character, and
merely represented three young men
travellers; but she generally, throughout
these volumes, speaks of that
favourite Spaniard in terms of the
highest admiration,&mdash;terms, as we
think, little merited. The angels in the
Sutherland Collection are as vulgar
figures as can well be, and quite antagonistic
in feeling to a heavenly mission.
We confess that we dislike
almost all the pictures by this so much
esteemed master: their artistic manner
is to us uncertain and unpleasing,&mdash;disagreeable
in colour, deficient in
grace. We often wonder at the excess
of present admiration. We look upon
his vulgarity in scriptural subjects as
quite profane. His highest power was
in a peasant gentleness; he could not
embody a sacred feeling: yet thus is
he praised for a performance beyond
his power:&mdash;"St Andrew is suspended
on the high cross, formed not of
planks, but of the trunks of trees laid
transversely. He is bound with cords,
undraped, except by a linen cloth,
his silver hair and beard loosely
streaming on the air, his aged countenance
illuminated by a heavenly
transport, as he looks up to the opening
skies, whence two angels, of really
celestial beauty, like almost all Murillo's
angels, descend with the crown
and palm." The angels of Correggio
are certainly peculiar: they are not
quite celestial, but perhaps are sympathetically
more lovely from their
touch of humanity; they are ever
pure. Those in the Ascension of the
the Virgin, in the Cupola at Parma,
seem to be rather adopted angels
than of the "first estate;" for they
are of several ages, and, if we mistake
not, many of them are feminine, and,
we suspect, are meant really to represent
the loveliest of earth beatified,
adopted into the heavenly choir.
Those who have seen Signor Toschi's
fine drawings of the Parma frescoes,
(now in progress of engraving), will
readily give assent to this impression.
We remember this feeling crossing our
mind, and as it were lightly touching
the heart with angelic wings&mdash;if we
have lost a daughter of that sweet
age, let us fondly see her there. We
cannot forbear quoting the passage
upon the angels of Titian:&mdash;"And
Titian's angels impress me in a similar
manner: I mean those in the
glorious Assumption at Venice, with
their childish forms and features, but
an expression caught from beholding
the face of 'our Father which is in
heaven:' it is glorified infancy. I
remember standing before this picture,
contemplating those lovely spirits one
after another, until a thrill came over
me, like that which I felt when Mendelssohn
played the organ: I became
music while I listened. The face of
one of those angels is to the face of a
child, just what that of the Virgin, in
the same picture, is, compared with
the fairest daughter of earth. It is
not here superiority of beauty, but
mind, and music, and love, kneaded
together, as it were, into form and
colour." This is very eloquent, but it
was not <em>the thought</em> which supplied
that ill word "kneaded."</p>

<p>It is remarked by Mrs Jameson, as
a singular fact, that neither Leonardo
da Vinci, nor Michael Angelo, nor
Raffaelle, have given representations
of the Four Evangelists. In very
early art they are mostly symbolised,
and sometimes oddly and uncouthly;
and even so by Angelico da Fiesole.
In Greek art, the Tetramorph, or
union of the four attributes in one
figure, is seen winged. "The Tetramorph,
in Western art, in some instances
became monstrous, instead of
mystic and poetical." The animal
symbols of the Evangelists, however
familiarised in the eyes of the people,
and therefore sanctioned to their feeling,
required the greatest judgment to
bring within the poetic of art. We
must look also to the most mysterious
subjects for the elucidation, such as
Raffaelle's Vision of Ezekiel. There
we view in the symbols a great prophetic,
subservient to the creating and
redeeming power, set forth and coming
out of that blaze of the clouds of
heaven that surround the sublime
Majesty.</p>

<p>The earlier painters were fond of
representing everything symbolically:
hence the twelve apostles are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
treated. In the descending scale, to
the naturalists, the mystic poetry was
reduced to its lowest element. The set
of the apostles by Agostino Caracci,
though, as Mrs Jameson observes,
famous as works of art, are condemned
as absolutely vulgar. "St John is
drinking out of a cup, an idea which
might strike some people as picturesque,
but it is in vile taste. It is
about the eighth century that the keys
first appear in the hand of St Peter.
In the old churches at Ravenna, it is
remarked, St Peter and St Paul do not
often appear." Ravenna, in the fifth
century, did not look to Rome for her
saints.</p>

<p>After his martyrdom, St Paul was,
it is said, buried in the spot where
was erected the magnificent church
known as St Paolo fuorè-le mura. "I
saw the church a few months before
it was consumed by fire in 1823. I
saw it again in 1847, when the restoration
was far advanced. Its cold magnificence,
compared with the impressions
left by the former structure, rich
with inestimable remains of ancient
art, and venerable from a thousand
associations, saddened and chilled me."
We well remember visiting this noble
church in 1816. A singular coincidence
of fact and prophecy has imprinted
this visit on our memory.
Those who have seen it before it was
burnt down, must remember the series
of portraits of popes, and that there
was room but for one more. We
looked to the vacant place, as directed
by our cicerone, whilst he told us
that there was a prophecy concerning
it to this effect, that when that space
was filled up there would be no more
popes. The prophecy was fulfilled,
at least with regard to that church,
for it was burnt down after that vacant
space had been occupied by the papal
portrait.</p>

<p>The subject of the Last Supper is
treated of in a separate chapter.
There has been a fresco lately discovered
at Florence, in the refectory
of Saint Onofrio, said to have been
painted by Raffaelle in his twenty-third
year. Some have thought it to
be the work of Neri de Bicci. Mrs
Jameson, without hesitation, pronounces
it to be by Raffaelle, "full of
sentiment and grace, but deficient, it
appears to me, in that depth and
discrimination of character displayed
in his later works. It is evident that
he had studied Giotto's fresco in the
neighbouring Santa Croce. The arrangement
is nearly the same." All
the apostles have glories, but that
round the head of Judas is smaller
than the others. Does the prejudice
against thirteen at table arise from
this betrayal by Judas, or from the
legend of St Gregory, who, when a
monk in the monastery of St Andrew,
was so charitable, that at length, having
nothing else to bestow, he gave
to an old beggar a silver porringer
which had belonged to his mother?
When pope, it was his custom to
entertain twelve poor men. On one
occasion he observed thirteen, and
remonstrated with his steward, who,
counting the guests, could see no more
than twelve. After removal from the
table, St Gregory called the unbidden
guest, thus visible, like the ghost of
Banquo, to the master of the feast
only. The old man, on being questioned,
declared himself to be the old
beggar to whom the silver porringer
had been given, adding, "But my
name is Wonderful, and through me
thou shalt obtain whatever thou shalt
ask of God." There is a famous fresco
on this subject by Paul Veronese, in
which the stranger is represented to
be our Saviour. To entertain even
angels unknowingly, and at convivial
entertainments, and visible perhaps
but to one, as a messenger of good or
of evil, would be little congenial with
the purport of such meetings.</p>

<p>Mrs Jameson objects to the introduction
of dogs in such a subject
as the Last Supper, but remarks
that it is supposed to show that
the supper is over, and the paschal
lamb eaten. It is so common that
we should rather refer it to a more
evident and more important signification,
to show that this institution
was not for the Jews only, and alluding
to the passage showing that "dogs
eat of the crumbs which fell from their
masters' table." The large dogs,
however, of Paul Veronese, gnawing
bones, do not with propriety represent
the passage; for there is reason to
believe that the word "crumbs" describes
the small pet dogs, which its
was the fashion for the rich to carry
about with them. The early painters
introduced Satan in person tempting
Judas. When Baroccio, with little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
taste, adopted the same treatment,
the pope, Clement VIII., ordered the
figure to be obliterated&mdash;"Che non gli
piaceva il demonio si dimésticasse
tanto con Gesu Christo." We know
not where Mrs Jameson has found the
anecdote which relates that Andrea
del Castagno, called the Infamous,
after he had assassinated Dominico
his friend, who had intrusted him with
Van Eyck's secret, painted his own
portrait in the character of Judas, from
remorse of conscience. We are not
sure of the story at all respecting
Andrea del Castagno: there may be
other grounds for doubting it, but this
anecdote, if true to the fact, would
rather indicate insanity than guilt.
The farther we advance in the history
and practice of art, the more we find
it suffering in sentiment from the infusion
of the classical. In the Pitti
Palace is a picture by Vasari of St
Jerome as a penitent, in which he has
introduced Venus and cupids, one of
whom is taking aim at the saint. It
is true that, as we proceed, legends
crowd in upon us, and the painters
find rather scope for fancy than subjects
for faith and resting-places for
devotion. Art, ever fond of female
forms, readily seized upon the legends
of Mary Magdalene. Her penitence
has ever been a favourite subject, and
has given opportunity for the introduction
of grand landscape backgrounds
in the lonely solitudes and
wildernesses of a rocky desert. The
individuality of the characters of
Mary and Martha in Scripture history
was too striking not to be taken advantage
of by painters. There is a
legend of an Egyptian penitent Mary,
anterior to that of Mary Magdalene,
which is curious. Whether this was
another Mary or not, she is represented
as a female anchoret; and we
are reminded thereby of the double
story of Helen of Troy, whom a real
or fabulous history has deposited in
Egypt, while the great poet of the
Iliad has introduced her as so visible
and palpable an agent in the Trojan
war, and not without a touch of penitence,
not quite characteristic of that
age. Accounts say that it was her
double, or eidolon, which figured at
Troy.</p>

<p>Mrs Jameson makes a good conjecture
with regard to the famous
picture by Leonardo da Vinci, known
as Modesty and Vanity, and that it is
Mary Magdalene rebuked by her sister
Martha for vanity and luxury, which
exactly corresponds with the legend
respecting her. We cannot forbear
quoting the following eloquent passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On reviewing generally the infinite
variety which has been given to these
favourite subjects, the life and penance of
the Magdalene, I must end where I began.
In how few instances has the result
been satisfactory to mind, or heart, or
soul, or sense! Many have well represented
the particular situation, the appropriate
sentiment, the sorrow, the hope, the
devotion; but who has given us the
<em>character</em>? A noble creature, with strong
sympathies and a strong will, with powerful
faculties of every kind, working for
good or evil. Such a woman Mary Magdalene
must have been, even in her humiliation;
and the feeble, girlish, commonplace,
and even vulgar women, who
appear to have been usually selected as
models by the artists, turned into Magdalenes
by throwing up their eyes and
letting down their hair, ill represent the
enthusiastic convert, or the majestic patroness!"</p></blockquote>

<p>The second volume commences with
the patron saints of Christendom.
These were delightful fables in the
credulous age of first youth, when
feeling was a greater truth than fact;
and we confess that we read these
legends now with some regret at our
abated faith, which we would not
even "now have shaken in the chivalric
characters of the seven champions
of Christendom."</p>

<p>The Romish Church (we say not
the Catholic, as Mrs Jameson so frequently
improperly terms <em>her</em>) readily
acted that part, to the people at large,
which nurses assume for the amusement
of their children; and in both
cases, the more improbable the story the
greater the fascination; and the people,
like children, are more credulous than
critical. Had we not known in our
own times, and nearly at the present
day, stories as absurd as any in these
legends, gravely asserted, circulated,
and credited, and maintained by men
of responsible station and education&mdash;to
instance only the garment of Treves&mdash;we
should have pronounced the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurea
legenda</i> to have been a creation of
the fancy, arising, not without their
illumination, from the fogs and fens of
the Middle Ages, adapted solely for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
minds of that period. But the sanction
of them by the Church of Rome
leads us to view them as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignes fatui</i> of
another character, meant to amuse
and to bewilder. We must even think
it possible now for people to be
brought to believe such a story as
this:&mdash;"It is related that a certain
man, who was afflicted with a cancer
in his leg, went to perform his devotions
in the church of St Cosmo and
St Damian at Rome, and he prayed
most earnestly that these beneficent
saints would be pleased to aid him.
When he had prayed, a deep sleep fell
upon him. Then he beheld St Cosmo
and St Damian, who stood beside
him; and one carried a box of ointment,
the other a sharp knife. And
one said, 'What shall we do to replace
this diseased leg, when we have cut it
off?' And the other replied, 'There
is a Moor who has been buried just
now in San Pietro in Vincolo; let us
take his leg for the purpose!' Then
they brought the leg of the dead man,
and with it they replaced the leg of
the sick man&mdash;anointing it with celestial
ointment, so that he remained
whole. When he awoke, he almost
doubted whether it could be himself;
but his neighbours, seeing that he was
healed, looked into the tomb of the
Moor, and found that there had been an
exchange of legs; and thus the truth
of this great miracle was proved to all
beholders." It is, however, rather a
hazardous demand upon credulity to
serve up again the feast of Thyestes,
cooked in a caldron of even more
miraculous efficacy than Medea's. Such
is the stupendous power of St Nicholas:&mdash;"As
he was travelling through
his diocese, to visit and comfort his
people, he lodged in the house of a
certain host, who was a son of Satan.
This man, in the scarcity of provisions,
was accustomed to steal little children,
whom he murdered, and served up
their limbs as meat to his guests. On
the arrival of the Bishop and his retinue,
he had the audacity to serve up
the dismembered limbs of these unhappy
children before the man of God,
who had no sooner cast his eyes on
them than he was aware of the fraud.
He reproached the host with his
abominable crime; and, going to the
tub where their remains were salted
down, he made over them the sign of
the cross, and they rose up whole and
well. The people who witnessed this
great wonder were struck with astonishment;
and the three children,
who were the sons of a poor widow,
were restored to their weeping mother."</p>

<p>But what shall we say to an entire
new saint of a modern day, who has
already found his way to Venice,
Bologna, and Lombardy,&mdash;even to
Tuscany and Paris, not only in pictures
and statues, but even in chapels
dedicated to her? The reader may be
curious to know something of a saint
of this century. In the year 1802 the
skeleton of a young female was discovered
in some excavations in the
catacomb of Priscilla at Rome; the
remains of an inscription were, "Lumena
Pax Te Cum Tri." A priest in
the train of a Neapolitan prelate,
who was sent to congratulate Pius
VII. on his return from France, begged
some relics. The newly-discovered
treasure was given to him, and the
inscription thus translated&mdash;"Filomena,
rest in peace." "Another
priest, whose name is suppressed <em>because
of his great humility</em>, was favoured
by a vision in the broad noonday,
in which he beheld the glorious
virgin Filomena, who was pleased to
reveal to him that she had suffered
death for preferring the Christian
faith, and her vow of chastity, to the
addresses of the emperor, who wished
to make her his wife. This vision
leaving much of her history obscure,
a certain young artist, whose name is
also suppressed&mdash;perhaps because of
his great humility&mdash;was informed in a
vision that the emperor alluded to was
Diocletian; and at the same time the
torments and persecutions suffered by
the Christian virgin Filomena, as well
as her wonderful constancy, were also
revealed to him. There were some
difficulties in the way of the Emperor
Diocletian, which inclines the writer of
the <em>historical</em> account to adopt the
opinion that the young artist in his
vision <em>may</em> have made a mistake, and
that the emperor may have been his
colleague, Maximian. The facts,
however, now admitted of no doubt;
and the relics were carried by the priest
Francesco da Lucia to Naples; they
were inclosed in a case of wood, resembling
in form the human body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
This figure was habited in a petticoat
of white satin, and over it a crimson
tunic, after the Greek fashion; the
face was painted to represent nature;
a garland of flowers was placed on the
head, and in the hands a lily and a
javelin&mdash;with the point reversed, to
express her purity and her martyrdom;
then she was laid in a half sitting posture
in a sarcophagus, of which the
sides were glass; and after lying for
some time in state, in the chapel of the
Torres family in the Church of Saint
Angiolo, she was carried in procession
to Magnano, a little town about twenty
miles from Naples, amid the acclamations
of the people, working many and
surprising miracles by the way. Such
is the legend of St Filomena, and such
the authority on which she has become,
within the last twenty years,
one of the most fashionable saints in
Italy. Jewels to the value of many
thousand crowns have been offered at
her shrine, and solemnly placed round
the neck of her image, or suspended
to her girdle."</p>

<p>We dare not in candour charge the
Romanists with being the only fabricators
or receivers of such goods, remembering
our own Saint Joanna,
and Huntingdon's Autobiography.
There are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurea legenda</i> in a certain
class of our sectarian literature,
presenting a large list of claimants of
very high pretensions to saintship,
only waiting for power and an established
authority to be canonised.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, as the world is&mdash;working
often in the dark places of
ignorance&mdash;if a few glossy threads of a
coarser material, and deteriorating
quality, be taken up by no wilful mistake,
and be interwoven into the true
golden tissue. Nevertheless the
mantle may be still beautiful, and fit
a Christian to wear and walk in not
unbecomingly. There are worse things
than religious superstition, whose badness
is of degrees. In the minds of
all nations and people there is a
vacuum for the craving appetite of
credulity to fill. The great interests
of life lie in politics and religion.
There are bigots in both: but we look
upon a little superstition on the one
point as far safer than upon the other,
especially in modern times; whereas
political bigotry, however often duped,
is credulous still, and becomes hating
and ferocious. We fear even the
legends are losing their authority in
the Roman States, whose history may
yet have to be filled with far worse
tales. A generous, though we deem
it a mistaken feeling, has induced Mrs
Jameson to make what we would
almost venture to call the only mistake
in her volumes: the following
passage is certainly not in good taste,
quite out of the intention of her book,
and very unfortunately timed&mdash;"But
Peter is certainly the democratical
apostle <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, and his representative
in our time seems to have
awakened to a consciousness of this
truth, and to have thrown himself&mdash;as
St Peter would most certainly have
done, were he living&mdash;on the side of
the people and of freedom." A democratical
successor to St Peter! He is,
then, the first of that character. With
him the "side of freedom" seems to
have been the inside of his prison,
and his "side of the people" a precipitate
flight from contact with them
in their liberty&mdash;and for his tiara the
disguise of a valet. We more than
pardon Mrs Jameson&mdash;we love the
virtue that gives rise to her error; for
it is peculiarly the nature of woman
to be credulous, and to be deceived.
We admire, and more than admire,
women equally well, whether they are
right or wrong in politics: these are the
business of men, for they have to do with
the sword, and are out of the tenderer
impulses of woman. But we are
amused when we find grave strong
men in the same predicament of ill
conjectures. We smile as we remember
a certain dedication "To Pio
Nono," which by its simple grandeur
and magnificent beauty will live
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">splendide mendax</i> to excuse its
prophetic inaccuracy. It is not wise
to foretell events to happen whilst we
live. Take a "long range," or a
studied ambiguity that will fit either
way. The example of Dr Primrose
may be followed with advantage, who
in every case of domestic doubt and
difficulty concluded the matter thus&mdash;"I
wish it may turn out well this day
six months;" by which, in his simple
family, he attained the character of a
true prophet.</p>

<p>We fear we are losing sight of the
"Poetry of Sacred and Legendary
Art," and gladly turn from the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of what is to be, to those beautiful personified
ideas of the past, whether
fabulous or historical, in which we are
ready to take Mrs Jameson as our
willing and sure guide. The four
virgin patronesses and the female
martyrs are favourite subjects, which
she enters into with more than her
usual spirit and feeling. These two
have chiefly engaged and fascinated
the genius of the painters of the best
period, and will ever interest the world
of taste by their sentiment, as well as
by their grace of form and beauty, and
why not say improved them too? The
really beautiful is always true. It is
not amiss that we should be continually
reminded, or, as Mrs Jameson
better expresses it&mdash;"It is not a thing
to be set aside or forgotten, that generous
men and meek women, strong in
the strength, and elevated by the sacrifice
of a Redeemer, did suffer, did
endure, did triumph for the truth's
sake; did leave us an example which
ought to make our hearts glow within
us." The memory of Christian heroism
should never be lost sight of in a
Christian country, and we earnestly
recommend this part of Mrs Jameson's
volumes to the attention of our painters:
they will find not unfrequent
instances of fine subjects yet untouched,
which may sanctify art, and dignify
the profession by making it the teacher
of a purer taste&mdash;not that true genius
will ever lack materials, for materials
are but suggestive to an innate inventive
power. It is curious that the
authoress should not yet have satisfied
our expectation with regard to the
legends of the Virgin. Whatever the
motive of her forbearance, we hope
this subject will take the lead in the
promised third volume, which is to
treat of the legends of the monastic
orders, considered, as she cautiously
observes, "merely in their connexion
with the development of the fine arts
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries."</p>

<p>The numerous pictures in Italy
which represent parts of the legends
of the Virgin render this work incomplete
without a full development of the
subject. If her forbearance arises
from a fear that at this particular time,
when mariolatry is dreaded by a large
portion of the religious world, we
would remind her that the Virgin
Mother is still "the blessed" of our
own church.</p>

<p>It is a question if the list of sainted
martyrs in repute has not been left to
the arbitrament of the painters; for
we find many deposed, and the adopted
favourites of art not found in the
early list, as represented in their processions.
We find a Saint Reparata,
after having been the patroness saint
of Florence for six hundred years,
deposed, and the city placed under
the tutelage of the Virgin and St John
the Baptist.</p>

<p>Yet these were early times for the
influence of art; but, at a period when
pictures were thought to have a kind
of miraculous power, it is not improbable
that some potent work of art
representing the Virgin and St John
may have caused the new devotional
dedication&mdash;as was the case in modern
times, when the imaged Madonna
de los Dolores was appointed
general-in-chief of the Carlist
army. Painters were what the
poets had been&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vates sacri</i>. Events
and the memory of saints may have
perished, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carent quia vate sacro</i>. We
wish our own painters were more fully
sensible of the power of art to perpetuate,
and that it is its province to
teach. With us it has been too long
disconnected with our religion. It
will be a glorious day for art, and for
the people that shall witness the reunion.</p>

<p>In taking leave of these two fascinating
volumes, we do so with the
less regret, knowing that they will
be often in our hands, as most valuable
for instant reference. No one
who wishes to know the subjects and
feel the sentiment of the finest works
in the world, will think of going
abroad without Mrs Jameson's book.
We must again thank her for the
beautiful woodcuts and etchings; the
latter, in particular, are lightly and
gracefully executed, we presume
mostly (to speak technically) in dry
point. Mrs Jameson writes as an enthusiast,
her feeling flows from her
pen. Her style is fascinating to a
degree, forcible and graceful; but
there is no mistaking its character&mdash;feminine.
We know no other
hand that could so happily have set
forth the <cite>Poetry of Sacred and Legendary
Art</cite>.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN THOUGHTS ON EUROPEAN REVOLUTIONS.</h2>


<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <em>December 1848</em>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Year of Constitutions</span> is
drawing to its end, to be succeeded, I
doubt not, by the Year of Substitutions.
I am sorry, my Basil, that
you do not quite agree with me as to
the issue of all this in France; but I
am sure you will not dispute my opinion
that this year's work is good for
nothing, so far as it has attempted
construction, instead of fulfilling its
mission by overthrow. Its great
folly has been the constitution-fever,
which has amounted to a pestilence.
When mushrooms grow to be oaks,
then shall such constitutions as this
year has bred, stand a chance of outliving
their authors. Will men learn
nothing from the past? How can
they act over such rotten farces,&mdash;make
themselves such fools!</p>

<p>You admit the difference, which I
endeavoured to show you, between
the American constitution and that of
any conceivable constitution which
may be cooked up for an old European
state. I am glad if I have directed
your attention, accordingly, to the
great mistake of France. She supposes
that a feeble, and debauched old
gentleman can boil himself in the
revolutionary kettle, and emerge in
all the tender and enviable freshness
of the babe just severed from the maternal
mould. Politicians have committed
a blunder in not allowing the
natural, and hence legitimate, origin
of the American constitution in that
of its British parent. They have thus
favoured the theory that a tolerably
permanent constitution can be drafted
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, and imposed upon a state.
This is the absurdity that makes revolutions.
If the silly French, instead
of reading De Tocqueville, would
study each for himself the history of
our constitution, and see how gradually
it grew to be our constitution,
before pen was put to paper to draft
it, they might perhaps stop their
abortive nonsense in time, to save
what they can of their national character
from the eternal contempt of
mankind.</p>

<p>But you cannot think the French
will find so fair a destiny as a Restoration!
Tell me, in what French
party, at present existing, there is
any inherent strength, save in that of
the legitimists? Other parties are
mere factions; but the legitimists
have got a seminal principle among
them, which dies very hard, and of
which the nature is to sprout and
make roots, and then show itself. I
am no admirer of the Bourbons:
their intrigues with Jesuitism have
been their curse, and are the worst
obstacle to their regaining a hold on
the sympathies of freemen. The
reactionary party have in vain endeavoured
to overcome it for fifty
years. Yet there is such tenacity of
life in legitimacy, that it seems to
me destined to outlive all opposition,
and to succeed by necessity. The
rapid developments of this memorable
year strengthen the probability of my
prediction. Revolutionism is spasmodic,
but not so long in dying as it
used to be. I cannot but think this
year has done more for a permanent
restoration of the Bourbons than any
year since Louis XVI. ascended the
scaffold. In this respect the Barricades
of 1848 may tell more impressively
on history than the Allies of
1814, or even the carnage of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Why should I be ashamed of my
theory, when everything, so far, has
gone as I supposed it would, only a
hundred times more rapidly than any
body could have thought possible?
What must be the residue of a series
which thus far has tended but one
way?&mdash;what say you of the Bartholomew-butchery
in June?&mdash;what of Lamartine's
fall?&mdash;what of the dictatorship
of Cavaignac? If things have
gone as seems probable, Louis Napoleon
is president of the republic. If
so, what is the instinct which has thus
called him into power? The hereditary
principle is abolished on paper,
and instantly recognised by the first
popular act done under the new constitution!
But, for all we can tell in
America, things may have taken
another turn. Is Cavaignac elected?
Then a military master is put over
the republic, who can <em>Cromwellise</em> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Assembly, and <em>Monk</em> the state, as
soon as he chooses. The republic
has given itself the form of a dictatorship,
and demonstrated that it
does not exist, except on paper.
Has there been an insurrection?
Then the republic is dead already.
But I shall assume that Louis has
succeeded: then it is virtually an
hereditary empire. To be sure, instinct
has for once failed to know
"the true prince,"&mdash;has accorded, to
the mere shadow of a usurper, what,
in a more substantial form, is due to
the heir of France; but long-suspended
animation must make a mistake
or two in coming to life again.
The events of the year have been all
favourable to a restoration, because
they have crushed a thousand other
plans and plottings for the sovereignty,
and because they must have
forced upon at least as many theorists
the grand practical conclusion, that
there is to be no rational liberty in
France until she returns to first principles,
and finds the repose which old
nations can only know under their
legitimate kings.</p>

<p>I am ashamed of you for more
than hinting that legitimacy must be
given up, as far as kings are concerned.
Alas! Diogenes must light
his lantern, and hunt through England
for a Tory! You are bewhigged,
indeed, if you give it up that George
III. was a legitimate king, and that
his grand-daughter is to you what no
other person alive can possibly be,&mdash;your
true and hereditary sovereign
lady! Must I, a republican, say this
to an English monarchist, who votes
himself a conservative, and who is
the son of a sturdy old English Tory?
Is there no virtue extant, that even
you allow yourself to be flippant
about "the divinity that hedges
kings," and to trifle with suggestions
which your immortal ancestor, who
fell at Prestonpans, would have
drummed out of doors with poker and
tongs? Why, even I, who have a
right to be whatever I choose, by
way of amateur allegiance, and who
have always found myself a Jacobite
whenever the talk has been against
the White Rose&mdash;even I, in sober
earnest, yield the point, that George
I. was a legitimate sovereign, and
that Charlie was a bit of a rebel.
Those stupid Dutchmen! it makes
me mad to say as much for them;
but I love Old England too well to
own that she bore with such sovereigns
on any lower grounds than
that of their right to reign.</p>

<p>I am sorry you give in to the silly
cant of revolutionists, and confess
yourself posed with their challenge.
What if they do insist upon a definition?
Are you bound to keep your
heart from beating till you can tell
why it throbs over a page of Shakspeare's
Richard II., and bounces,
in precisely an opposite manner, over
Carlyle's Cromwell? Am I going to
let a Whig choke me with a dictionary,
because it contains no explanation
of my good old-fashioned
word? Let him, with his "Useful
Knowledge Society" information, give
me an explanation of the magnetic
needle, or tell me why it turns to the
pole, and not to the antipodes? The
fellow will recollect some twopenny
picture of the compass, and retail me
half a column of the Penny Magazine
about the mysteries of nature. And
what if I talk as sensibly from nature
in my own heart, and tell the stereotype
philosopher that I am conscious
of an ennobling affection, which honest
men never lack, and which God Almighty
has made a faculty of the
human soul to dignify subordination;
and that loyalty has no lode-star but
legitimacy? At least, my dear
Whigo-Tory, you must allow, I should
succeed in answering a fool according
to his folly. But I claim more: I
have defined legitimacy when I say it
is the home of loyalty.</p>

<p>I have amused myself during the
summer with some study of the history
of reaction in France, and flatter
myself that I have discovered the
secret of its failure, and the great distinction
between its spirit and that of
English Conservatism. But this by
the way; for I was going to say that
I have found, in the writings of one
of the chief of the reactionary party,
some very sensible hints upon the
subject I am discussing with you.
Though in many respects a dangerous
teacher, and, I fear, a little jesuitical
in practice as well as in
theory, I have been surprised to find
the Count de Maistre willing "to be
as <em>his master</em>" on this point, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
rest legitimacy very nearly on the
sober principles of Burke. He is far
from the extravagances of Sir Robert
Filmer, though he often expresses, in
a startling form, the temperate views
of English Anti-Jacobins. Thus he
says, with evident relish of its smart
severity, <em>the people will always accept
their masters, and will never choose
them</em>. Strongly and unpalatably put,
but most coincident with history, and
not to be disputed by any admirer of
the glorious Revolution of 1688! I
suspect the Frenchman made his aphorism
without stopping to ask whether
it suited any other case. But Burke
has virtually said the same thing in
his reply to the Old Jewry doctrine
of 1789, in which he so forcibly urges
the fact, that the settlement of the
crown upon William and the Georges
"was not properly <em>a choice</em>, ...
but an act of necessity, in the strictest
moral sense in which necessity can
be taken." Mary and the Hanoverians,
then, were acknowledged by the
nation, in spite of itself, as legitimate
sovereigns; and even William was
smuggled into the acknowledgment as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</i>-legitimate. It is the clear, reasonable,
and truly English doctrine of
Burke, that <em>the constitution of a country
makes its legitimate kings</em>; and that
the princes of the House of Brunswick,
coming to the crown according to constitutional
law, at the date of their
respective accessions, were as legitimate
as King James before he broke
his coronation oaths, and abdicated,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i>, his crown and hereditary
rights. But De Maistre talks more
like the schoolmen, though he comes
to the same practical results. Constitutions,
the native growth of their
respective countries, he would argue,
are the ordinance of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and kings,
though not the subjects of their
people, are bound to do homage to
them, as, in a sense, divine. Legitimacy,
therefore, is the resultant of
hereditary majesty and constitutional
designation; it being always understood
that constitutional laws are
never written till after they become
such by national necessities, which are
divine providences. Apply this to
1688. The Bill of Rights was an
unwritten part of the constitution
even when James was crowned; and
so was the principle, that the king
must not be a Papist, at least in the
government of his realms. Such, if I
may so speak, was the Salic law of
England, by which his public and
political Popery stripped him of his
right to the throne. It was the same
principle that invested the House of
Brunswick with a legitimacy which
the heart of the nation did not hesitate
to recognise, in spite of unfeigned
disgust with the prince in whom the
succession was established. To throw
the proposition into the abstract&mdash;there
can be no legitimacy without
hereditary majesty, but that member
of a royal line is the legitimate king
in whom concur all the elements of
<em>constitutional designation</em>. If the
phrase be new, the idea is as old as
empire. I mean that constitutional
power which, without reference to
national choice or personal popularity,
selects the true heir of the throne,
among the descendants of its ancient
possessors, on fixed principles of national
law. Thus, in Portugal, the
constitution sets aside an idiot heir-apparent
for a cadet of the same
family, or, if need be, for a collateral
relative; while, in France, it proclaims
the line of a king extinct in his
female heir, and ascends, perhaps, to
a remote ancestor for a trace of his
rightful successor. It is a principle
essentially the same which, in England,
pronounces a Popish prince as
devoid of hereditary right to the crown,
as a bastard, or the child of a private
marriage; and by which the hereditary
blood, shut off from its natural
course, immediately opens some auxiliary
channel, and widens it into the
main artery of succession, with all the
precision of similar resources in physical
nature. With such an argument,
if I understand him, the Count de
Maistre would put you to the blush
for sneering <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosâ</i> at the legitimacy
of your Sovereign. I wish his principles
were always as capable of being
put to the proof, without any absurdity
in the reduction. Hereditary
majesty is the only material of which
constitutions make sovereigns; and
that, too, deserves a word in the light
which this sage Piedmontese Mentor
of France has endeavoured to throw
on the subject. It is interesting in
the present dilemma of France, which
stands like the ass between two haystacks&mdash;rejecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
one dynasty, but not
yet choosing another. I am a republican,
you know, holding that my
loyalty is due to the constitution of
my own country; and yet I subscribe
to the doctrine that this idea of <em>majesty</em>
is a reality, and that, confess it
or not, even republicans feel its reality.
<em>The king's name is a tower of strength</em>;
and inspiration has said to sovereign
princes, with a pregnant and monitory
meaning&mdash;<em>ye are gods</em>. This is not
the fawning of courts, but the admonition
of Him who invests them with
His sword of avenging justice, and
gives them, age after age, the natural
homage of their fellow-men. Not
that I would flatter monarchs: I see
that they <em>die like men</em>, and, what is
worse, live, very often, like fools, if not
like beasts. Yet I am sure that they
have something about them which is
personally theirs, and cannot be given
to others, and which is as real a thing
as any other possession. <span class="smcap">God</span> has
endowed them with history, and they
are the living links which connect
nations with their origin, and the
men of the passing age with bygone
generations. Reason about it as we
may, it is impossible not to look with
natural reverence on the breathing monuments
of venerable antiquity. For
a Guelph, indeed, I cannot get up any
false or romantic enthusiasm; and
yet I find it quite as impossible not
to feel that the house of Guelph entitles
its royal members to a degree
of consideration which is the ordinance
of Heaven. For how many
ages has that house been a great reality,
casting its shadow over Europe,
and stretching it over the world, and
as absolutely affecting the destinies of
men as the geographical barriers and
highways of nations! The Alps and
the Oceans are morally, as well as
naturally, majestic; and a moral
majesty like theirs attaches to a line
of princes which has stood the storms
of centuries like them, and like them
has been always a bulwark or a bond
between races and generations. Like
the solemnity of mountains is the
hereditary majesty of a family, of
which the origin is veiled in the
twilight of history, but which is always
seen above the surface of cotemporary
events, a crowned and sceptred thing
that never dies, but perpetuates, from
generation to generation, a still increasing
emotion of sublimity and
awe, which all men feel, and none can
fully understand. There are many
women in England who, for personal
qualities and graces, would as well
become the throne as she whom you so
loyally entitle "Our Sovereign Lady."
Why is it that no election, nor any
imaginable possession of her place,
could commend the proudest or the
best of them to the homage of the
nation's heart? Such a one might
wear the robes, and glitter like a star,
outshining the regalia, and might
walk like Juno; but not a voice would
cry <em>God save her!</em>&mdash;while there is a
glory, not to be mistaken, which invests
the daughter of ancient sovereigns,
even when she is recognised,
against her will, in the costume of
travel, or when she shows herself
among her people, and treads the
heather in a trim little bonnet and
a Highland plaid. Why is it that ten
thousand feel a thrill when her figure
is seen descending from the wooden
walls of her empire, and alighting
upon some long unvisited portion of
its soil? It is not the same emotion
which would be inspired by the landing
of Wellington. Then the roaring of
cannon and the waving of ensigns
would appear to be a tribute rendered
to the hero by a grateful country; but
when her Majesty touches the shore,
she seems herself to wake the thunders
and to bow the banners which announce
her coming. The pomp is all
her own, and differs from the tributary
pageant, as the nod of Jove is different
from the acclamation of Stentor.
Even I, who "owe her no subscription,"
can well conceive what a true
Briton cannot help but feel, when,
with an ennobling loyalty, he beholds
in her the concentrated blood of famous
kings, and the propagated soul of
mighty monarchs; and when he calls
to mind, at the same moment, the
thousand strange events and glorious
histories which have their august
and venerable issue in Victoria, his
queen.</p>

<p>But you will bring me back to my
main business, by asking&mdash;who, then,
was the legitimate king of France at
the beginning of this year? The King
of the Barricades was not lacking in
hereditary majesty, and you will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
out a case of <em>constitutional designation</em>,
by a parallel between England in
1688, and France in 1830. If you do
so, you will greatly wrong your country.
The loyalty of England settled
in the house of Brunswick, and would
have been even less tried if there had
been a continuance of the house of
Orange; but no French loyalist could
ever be reconciled to the dynasty of
Orleans. And why? It was not the
natural constitution of France, but the
mere blunder of a mob, that selected
Louis Philippe as the king of the
French. It was an election, as the
accession of William and Mary was
not: it was a choice, and not a necessity&mdash;the
mere caprice of the hour,
and in no sense the rational designation
of law. Did ever his Barricade
Majesty himself, in all his dreams of
a dynasty, pretend that any unalterable
principle, or fundamental law of
France, had turned the tide of succession
from the heir-presumptive of
Charles X., and forced heralds upon
the backward trail of genealogy,
till they could again descend, and so
find the hereditary king of the French
in the son of Egalité? Louis Philippe
was not legitimate, in any reasonable
sense of the word; and, could he have
made such men as Chateaubriand regard
him as other than a usurper, he
would not be at Claremont now.
That splendid Frenchman uttered the
voice of a smothered, but not extinguished,
constitution, when he closed
his political life in 1830, by saying to
the Duchess de Berry&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame, votre
fils est mon roi.</i>" He lived to see the
secret heart of thousands of his countrymen
repeating his memorable
words, and died not till Providence
itself had overturned the rival throne,
and directed every eye in hope, or in
alarm, to the only prince in Europe
who could claim to be their king.</p>

<p>I care very little what may be the
personal qualifications of Henry of
Bordeaux; it seems to me that he
is destined to reign upon the throne
of his ancestors&mdash;and God grant he
may do it in such wise as shall make
amends for all that France has suffered,
by reason of his ancestors, since
France had a Henry for her king before!
The prestige of sovereignty is
his; and while he lives, no republic
can be lasting; no government, save
his, can insure the peace which the
state of Europe so imperatively demands.
If "experience has taught
England that in no other course or
method than that of an hereditary
crown her liberties can be regularly
perpetuated and preserved sacred,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;why
should not an experience, a
thousandfold severer, teach France
the same lesson? It has already been
taught them by a genius which France
cannot despise, and to whose oracular
voice she is now forced to listen, because
it issues from his fresh grave!
"Legitimacy is the very life of
France. Invent, calculate, combine
all sorts of illegitimate governments,
you will find nothing else possible as
the result, nothing which gives any
promise of duration, of tolerable existence
during a course of years, or even
through several months. Legitimacy
is, in Europe, the sanctuary in which
alone reposes that sovereignty by
which states subsist." So I endeavour
to render the eloquent sentence of
Chateaubriand;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and though, since he
wrote it, a score of years have passed,
it is stronger now than ever&mdash;for what
was then his prophecy is already the
deplorable history of his country.
Had ever a country such a history,
without learning more in a year than
France has gained from a miserable
half-century?</p>

<p>Just so long as France has been
busy with experiments, in the insane
effort to separate her future from her
past, just so long have all her labours
to lay a new foundation been miserable
failures, covering her, in the eyes
of the world, with shame and infamy.
What has been wanting all the time?
I grant that the first want has been
a national conscience&mdash;a sense of religion
and of duty. But I mean, what
has been wanting to the successive
administrations and governments?
Certainly not splendour and personal
dignity, for the Imperial government
had both; and the King of the Barricades
made himself to be acknowledged
and feared as one who bore not
the sword in vain. But the prestige
of legitimacy was wanting; and that
want has been the downfall of everything
that has been tried. You will
ask, what was the downfall of Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
X? The answer is, that it was
not a downfall further than concerned
himself; for everybody feels
that the Bourbon claim survives, while
every other has been forced to yield
to destiny and retribution. How is
it that legitimacy makes itself felt
after years of exile and obscurity? Is
it not that instinct of loyalty which
cannot be duped or diverted, and
which detects and detests all shams?
Is it not the instinct which constitution-makers
have endeavoured to appease
by pageants and by names, but which
has continually revolted against the
emptiness of both? The existence of
that instinct has been perpetually exposed
by miserable attempts to satisfy
its demands with outside show and
splendid impositions. The French
cannot even go to work, under their
present republic, as we do in America.
The common-sense of our people
teaches them that a republican government
is a mere matter of business,
which must make no pretences to splendour;
and hence, the constitution once
settled, the president is elected and
sworn-in with no nonsense or parade;
and Mr Cincinnatus Polk sits down
in the White House, and sends every
man about his business. A young
country has as yet but the instincts of
infancy; there is as yet nothing to
satisfy but the craving for nourishment,
and the demand for large room.
But it is not so where nations are full-grown.
<em>Can a maid forget her ornaments,
or a bride her attire?</em> Can
France forget that she had once a
court and a throne that dazzled the
world? No! says every craftsman of
the revolution; and therefore our
republic, too, must be splendid and
imperial! So, instead of going to work
as if their new constitution were a
reality, there must be a fète of inauguration.
In the same conviction, Napoleon
is nominated for the presidency,
because he has a name; and he immediately
withdraws from vulgar
eyes, to keep his "presence like a
robe pontifical," against the investiture.
Oh, for some Yankee farmer
to look on and laugh! It would not
take him long to <em>calculate</em> the end of
such a republic. Jonathan can understand
a queen, and would stare at a
coronation in sober earnest, convinced
that it had a meaning&mdash;at least, in
England! But a republic of kettle-drums
and trumpets will never do with
him; and if he were favoured with an
interview with the pompous aspirant
to the French presidency, it would
probably end in his telling Louis Napoleon
the homely truth&mdash;that he has
nothing to be proud of, and had better
eat and drink like other folk, and
"define his position" as a candidate,
if he don't want to find himself <em>used-up</em>,
and sent on a long voyage up
Salt River; which, you may not
know, my Basil, is a Stygian stream,
and the ancients called it Lethe. So
much, then, for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima ratio</i> of
illegitimate governments&mdash;the attempt
to satisfy the demand for national
dignity by pageants and by names,
and to drown the outcries of natural
discontent by the sounding of brass
and the tinkling of cymbals.</p>

<p>In vain did the sage Piedmontese
foretell it all, like a Cassandra. "Man
is prohibited," said that admirable
Mentor, "from giving great names to
things of which he is the author, and
which he thinks great; but if he has
proceeded legitimately, the vulgar
names of things will be rendered illustrious,
and become grand." How
specially does England answer to the
latter half of this maxim! and who
can read the former without seeing
France, in her fool's-cap, before his
mental eye? De Maistre himself has
instanced the revolutionary follies of
Paris, and lashed them with unsparing
severity. Whatever is national in
England seems to have grown up, like
her oaks, from deep and strong roots,
and to stand, like them, immovable,
They make their own associations,
and dignify their own names. Everything
is home-born, natural, and real.
The Garter, the Wool-sack, Hyde
Park, Epsom and Ascot&mdash;these things
in France would be the <em>Legion of
Honour</em>, the <em>Curule-chair</em>, the <em>Elysian
fields</em>, the <em>Olympic games</em>! The veritable
attempt was made to reinstitute,
in the Champ-de-Mars, the sports of
antiquity; and they received the
pompous name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les jeux Olympiques</i>.
De Maistre ridicules their nothingness,
and adds that, when he saw a building
erected and called the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Odéon</i>, he was
sure that music was in its decline,
and that the place would shortly be to
let. In like manner, he says of the
motto of Rousseau, with intense <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïvete</i>,
"Does any man dare to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
under his own portrait, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitam impendere
vero</i>? You may wager, without further
information, fearlessly, that it is
the likeness of a liar." How quick
the human heart perceives what is
thus put into words by a philosopher!
It is in vain for France to think of
covering her nakedness with a showy
veil. The Empire was a glittering
gauze, but how transparent! They
saw one called Emperor and a second
Charlemagne; and the Pope himself
was there to give him a crown. But
it was a meagre cheat. Poor Josephine
never looked ridiculous before, but
then she acted nonsense. The imperial
robes were gorgeous, but they
meant nothing on the Citizen Buonaparte.
Everybody saw behind the
scenes. They detected Talma in the
strut of Napoleon; they pointed at
the wires that moved the hands and
eyes of the Pope. All stage-effect,
machinery, and pasteboard. The imperial
court was all what children call
<em>make-believe</em>: it vanished like the
sport of children.</p>

<p>The great feast of fraternity, last
spring, was, on de Maistre's principles,
the natural harbinger of that fraternal
massacre in June; and the ineffectual
attempt to be festive over the
late inauguration of the constitution,
has but one redeeming feature to prevent
a corresponding augury of disaster.
Its miserable failure makes it
possible that the constitution will survive
its anniversary. Then there will
be a demonstration, at any rate, and
then the thing will be superannuated.
Since 1790, there has been no end to
such glorifications; each chased and
huzza'd, in turn, by a nation of full-grown
children, and all hollow and
transient as bubbles. Perpetual beginnings,
every one warranted to be
<em>no failure this time</em>, and each going
out in a stench. What continual
<i lang="frla" xml:lang="fr">Champs-de-Mars</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Champs-de-Mai</i>!
what wavings of new flags, and
scattering of fresh flowers! and all
ending in confessed failure, and beginning
the same thing over again! "Nothing
great has great beginnings"&mdash;says
Mentor again. "History shows no
exception to this rule. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crescit occulto
velut arbor ævo</i>,&mdash;this is the immortal
device of every great institution."</p>

<p>Legitimacy never makes such mistakes,
except when permitted by <span class="smcap">God</span>,
to accomplish its own temporary
abasement. It needs not to support
itself by tricks and shams. It has a
creative power which dignifies everything
it touches; which often turns
its own occasions into festivals, but
makes no festivals on purpose to
dignify itself. When Henry V. is
crowned at Rheims, or at Notre-Dame,
he will not send over the Alps
for <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pio Nono</i>, nor consult <i>Savans</i> to
learn how Cæsar should be attired
that day. That youth may safely
dispense with all superfluous pageantry,
for he is not <em>new Charlemagne</em>,
but <em>old Charlemagne</em>. The blood of
the Carlovingians has come down to
him from Isabella of Hainault, through
St Louis and Henry IV. Chateaubriand
should not have forgotten
this, when (speaking of this prince's
unfortunate father, the Duke de
Berry) he enthusiastically sketched a
thousand years of Capetian glory,
and cried&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">He bien! la revolution a
livré tout cela au couteau de Louvel</i>."
Another revolution has thus far relegated
the same substantial dignity
to exile and obscurity, as if France
could afford to lose its past, and begin
again, as an infant of days. But
besides the evident tendency of things
to reaction, there is something about
the legitimate king of France which
looks like destiny. He was announced
to the kingdom by the dying lips of
his murdered sire, while yet unborn,
as if the fate of empire depended on
his birth. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ménagez-vous, pour l'enfant
que vous portez dans votre sein</i>," said
the unhappy man to his duchess, and
the group of bystanders was startled!
It was the first that France heard of
Henry the Fifth, and it seemed to inspire
Chateaubriand with the spirit
of prophecy, and he eloquently remarks
upon it as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dernière espérance</i>.
"The dying prince," he says, "seemed
to bear with him a whole monarchy,
and at the same moment to announce
another. Oh <span class="smcap">God</span>! and is our salvation
to spring out of our ruin? Has
the cruel death of a son of France
been ordained in anger, or in mercy?
is it <em>a final restoration of the legitimate
throne, or the downfall of the empire
of Clovis</em>?" This grand question now
hangs in suspense: but, as I said,
Chateaubriand must have taken courage
before he died, and inwardly
answered it favourably. That great
writer seems to have felt beforehand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
for his countrymen, the loyalty to
which they will probably return. To
the prince he stood as a sort of sponsor
for the future. When the royal
babe was baptised, he presented
water from the Jordan, in which the
last hope of legitimacy received the
name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dieu-donné</i>: when Charles
the Tenth was dethroned, he stood
up for the young king, and consented
to fall with his exclusion; and the
last years of France's greatest genius
were a consistent confessorship for
that legitimacy with which he believed
the prosperity of his country
indissolubly bound. Now, I should
like to ask a French republican&mdash;if I
could find a sane one,&mdash;what would
you wish to do with Henry of Bordeaux?
Would you wish this heir
of your old histories to renounce his
birth-right, declare legitimacy an imposition,
and undertake to settle
down in Paris as one of the people?
Why not, if you are all republicans,
and see no more in a prince than in a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</i>? Why should not this Henry
Capet throw up his cap for the constitution,
and stick up a tradesman's
sign in the Place de la Revolution, as
"Henry Capet, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parfumeur</i>?" Why
not let him hire a shop in the lower
stories of the Palais Royal and teach
the Parisians better manners than to
cut off his head, by devoting himself
to shaving their beards? Everybody
knows the reason why not; and that
reason shows the reality of legitimacy.
Night and day such a shop would be
mobbed by friends and foes alike.
Go where he might, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parfumeur</i>
would be pointed at by fingers, and
aimed at by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lorgnettes</i>, and bored to
death by a rabble of starers, who
would insist upon it that he was the
hereditary lord of France. Mankind
cannot free themselves from such impressions,
and, what is more conclusive,
princes cannot free themselves
from the impressions of mankind, or
undertake to live like other men, as
if history and genealogy were not
facts. For weal or for woe, they are
as unchangeable as the leopard with
his spots. Let Henry Capet come to
America, and try to be a republican
with us. Our very wild-cats would
assert their inalienable right to "look at
a king," and he would certainly be torn
to pieces by good-natured curiosity.</p>

<p>It is curious to see the natural
instinct amusing itself, for the present,
with such a mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nominis umbra</i> as
Louis Napoleon. In some way or
other the hereditary <em>prestige</em> must be
created; nothing less is satisfactory,
and the "imperial fetishism" will
answer very well till something more
substantial is found necessary. Richard
Cromwell was necessary to Charles
II., and so is Louis Napoleon to
Henry V. Napoleon still seems capable
of giving France a dynasty; this
possibility will be soon extinguished
by the incapability of his representative.
Louis will reign long enough
to exhibit that recompense to Josephine,
in the person of her grandson,
which heaven delights to allot to a
repudiated wife; and then, for his
own sake, he will be called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coquin</i>
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poltron</i>. Napoleon will take his
historical position as an individual,
having no remaining hold on France;
and the imperial fetishism will be
ignominiously extinguished. Richard
Cromwell made a very decent old
English gentleman, and Louis Napoleon
may perhaps end his days as
respectably, in some out-of-the-way
corner of Corsica. Let me again
quote the French Mentor. He says,
"There never has existed a royal
family to whom a plebeian origin could
be assigned. Men may say, if Richard
Cromwell had possessed the genius of
his father, he would have fixed the
protectorate in his family; which is
precisely the same thing as to say&mdash;if
this family had not ceased to reign,
it would reign still." Here is the
formula that will suit the case of Louis
Napoleon; but future historians will
moralise upon the manner in which
Napoleon himself worked out his
own destruction. For the sake of a
dynasty, he puts away poor Josephine.
The King of Rome is born to him, but
his throne is taken. The royal youth
perishes in early manhood, and men
find Napoleon's only representative
in the issue of the repudiated wife.
Her grandson comes to power, and
holds it long enough to make men
say&mdash;how much better it might have
been with Napoleon had he kept his
faith to Josephine, and contentedly
taken as his heir the child in whom
Providence has revealed at last his
only chance of continuing his family
on a throne! It makes one thing of
Scripture, "Yet ye say wherefore?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
because the Lord hath been witness
between thee and the wife of thy
youth, against whom thou hast dealt
treacherously; ... therefore take
heed to your spirit, and let none deal
treacherously against the wife of his
youth, for the Lord, the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Israel,
saith that he hateth putting away."</p>

<p>A traveller from the south of France
says that he saw everywhere the portrait
of Henry V. Besides the mysterious
hold which legitimacy keeps upon
the vulgar and the polite alike, there
are associations with it which operate
on all classes of men. Tradesmen and
manufacturers are for legitimacy, because
they love peace, and want to
make money. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roturiers</i> sooner
or later learn the misery of mobs, and
the love of change makes them willing
to welcome home the king, especially
as they mistake their own hearts, and
flatter themselves that their sudden
loyalty is proof of remaining virtue.
Then the profligate and abandoned,
they want a monarchy, in hopes of
another riot in the palace. It may
be doubted whether the <em>blouses</em> can
be permanently contented without a
king to curse. The national anthem
cannot be sung with any spirit, unless
there be a monarch who can be
imagined to hear all its imprecations
against tyrants: in fact, the king
must come back, if only to make sense
of the Marseilles Hymn.</p>

<p class="noind">What imaginable sense is there in
singing these red-hot verses at a feast
of fraternity, and in honour of the full
possession of absolute liberty? Then,
where is the sport of clubs, and the
excitement of conspiracies, if there's
no king to execrate within locked
doors? Is Paris to have no more of
those nice little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeutes</i>? What's to
be done with the genius that delights
in infernal machines? Who's to be
fired at in a glass coach? Everybody
knows that Cavaignacs and Lamartines
are small game for such sport.
Your true assassin must have, at least,
a duke of the blood. These are considerations
which must have their
weight in deciding upon probabilities;
though, for one, I am not sure but
France is doomed, by retributive
justice, to be thus the Tantalus of
nations, steeped to the neck in liberty,
but forbidden to drink, with kings
hanging over them to provoke the eye,
and yet escaping the hand.</p>

<p>In 1796 de Maistre published his
<cite>Considérations sur la France</cite>. They
deserve to be reproduced for the present
age. Nothing can surpass the
cool contempt of the philosophical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réactionnaire</i>, or the confidence with
which, from his knowledge of the past,
he pronounces oracles for the future.
Do you ask how Henry V. is to recover
his rights? In ten thousand
imaginable ways. See what Cavaignac
might have done last July, had
the time been ripe for another Monk!
There's but one way to keep legitimacy
out; it comes in as water enters
a leaky ship, oozing through seams,
and gushing through cracks, where
nobody dreamed of such a thing. As
long as even a tolerable pretender
survives, a popular government must
be kept in perpetual alarm. But you
shall hear the Count, my Basil! Let
me give you a free translation.</p>

<p>"In speculating about counter-revolutions,
we often fall into the mistake
of taking it for granted that such
reactions can only be the result of
popular deliberation. <em>The people won't
allow it</em>, it is said; <em>they will never consent;
it is against the popular feeling</em>.
Ah! is it possible? The people just
go for nothing in such affairs; at most
they are a passive instrument. Four
or five persons may give France a
king. It shall be announced to the
provinces that the king is restored:
up go their hats, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vive le roi</i>!
Even in Paris, the inhabitants, save
a score or so, shall know nothing of
it till they wake up some morning and
learn that they have a king. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-il
possible?</i>' will be the cry: '<em>how very
singular! What street will he pass
through? Let's engage a window in
good time, there'll be such a horrid
crowd!</em>' I tell you the people will
have nothing more to do with re-establishing
the monarchy, than they
have had in establishing the revolutionary
government!... At the
first blush one would say, undoubtedly,
that the previous consent of the French
is necessary to the restoration; but
nothing is more absurd. Come, we'll
crop theory, and imagine certain
facts.</p>

<p>"A courier passes through Bordeaux,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Nantes, Lyons, and so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>,
telling everybody that the king is
proclaimed at Paris; that a certain
party has seized the reins, and has
declared that it holds the government
only in the king's name, having despatched
an express for his majesty,
who is expected every minute, and
that every one mounts the white
cockade. Rumour catches up the
story, and adds a thousand imposing
details. What next? To give the republic
the fairest chance, let us suppose
it to have the favour of a majority,
and to be defended by republican
troops. At first these troops shall
bluster very loudly; but dinner-time
will come; the fellows must eat,
and away goes their fidelity to a
cause that no longer promises rations,
to say nothing of pay. Then
your discontented captains and lieutenants,
knowing that they have nothing
to lose, begin to consider how
easily they can make something of
themselves, by being the first to set
up <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive-le-roi</i>! Each one begins to
draw his own portrait, most bewitchingly
coloured; looking down in scorn
on the republican officers who so lately
knocked him about with contempt;
his breast blazing with decorations,
and his name displayed as that of an
officer of His Most Christian Majesty!
Ideas so single and natural will work
in the brains of such a class of persons:
they all think them over; every one
knows what his neighbour thinks, and
they all eye one another suspiciously.
Fear and distrust follow first, and
then jealousy and coolness. The common
soldier, no longer inspired by his
commander, is still more discouraged;
and, as if by witchcraft, the bonds of
discipline all at once receive an incomprehensible
blow, and are instantly
dissolved. One begins to
hope for the speedy arrival of his
majesty's paymaster; another takes
the favourable opportunity to desert
and see his wife. There's no
head, no tail, and no more any such
thing as trying to hold together.</p>

<p>"The affair takes another turn with
the populace. They push about
hither and thither, knocking one another
out of breath, and asking all sorts
of questions; no one knows what he
wants; hours are wasted in hesitation,
and every minute does the business.
Daring is everywhere confronted by
caution; the old man lacks decision,
the lad spoils all by indiscretion; and
the case stands thus,&mdash;one may get
into trouble by resisting, but he that
keeps quiet may be rewarded, and
will certainly get off without damage.
As for making a demonstration&mdash;where
is the means? Who are the
leaders? Whom can ye trust? There's
no danger in keeping still; the least
motion may get one into trouble.
Next day comes news&mdash;<em>such a town
has opened its gates</em>. Another inducement
to hold back! Soon this news
turns out to be a lie; but it has been
believed long enough to determine
two other towns, who, supposing that
they only follow such example, present
themselves at the gates of the first
town to offer their submission. This
town had never dreamed of such a
thing; but, seeing such an example,
resolves to fall in with it. Soon it
flies about that Monsieur the mayor
has presented to his majesty the keys
of his good city of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelquechose</i>, and
was the first officer who had the honour
to receive him within a garrison
of his kingdom. His Majesty&mdash;of
course&mdash;made him a marshal of France
on the spot. Oh! enviable brevet!
an immortal name, and a scutcheon
everlastingly blooming with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleurs-de-lis</i>!
The royalist tide fills up every
moment, and soon carries all before it.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive-le-roi!</i> shouts out long-smothered
loyalty, overwhelmed with transports:
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive-le-roi!</i> chokes out hypocritical
democracy, frantic with terror. No
matter! there's but one cry; and his
Majesty is crowned, and <em>has all the
royal makings of a king</em>. This is the
way counter-revolutions come about.
God having reserved to himself the
formation of sovereignties, lets us learn
the fact, from observing that He never
commits to the multitude the choice
of its masters. He only employs them,
in those grand movements which decide
the fate of empires, as passive
instruments. Never do they get what
they want: they always take; they
never choose. There is, if one may
so speak, an <em>artifice</em> of Providence, by
which the means which a people take
to gain a certain object, are precisely
those which Providence employs to
put it from them. Thus, thinking to
abase the aristocracy by hurrahing for
Cæsar, the Romans got themselves
masters. It is just so with all popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
insurrections. In the French
revolution the people have been perpetually
handcuffed, outraged, betrayed,
and torn to pieces by factions;
and factions themselves, at the mercy
of each other, have only risen to take
their turn in being dashed to atoms.
To know in what the revolution will
probably end, find first in what points
all the revolutionary factions are
agreed. Do they unite in hating
Christianity and monarchy? Very
well! The end will be, that both will
be the more firmly established in the
earth."</p>

<p>Cool, certainly; is it not, my Basil?
The legitimists are the only Frenchmen
who can keep cool, and bide their
time. Chateaubriand has observed,
in the same spirit, that there is a
hidden power which often makes war
with powers that are visible, and that
a secret government was always following
close upon the heels of the
public governments that succeeded
each other between the murder of
Louis XVI. and the restoration of
the Bourbons. This hidden power he
calls the eternal reason of things; the
justice of <span class="smcap">God</span>, which interferes in
human affairs just in proportion as
men endeavour to banish and drive it
from them. It is evident that the
whole force of de Maistre's prophecy
was owing to his religious confidence
in this divine interference.
He wrote in 1796. That year the
career of Napoleon began at Montenotte;
and, for eighteen years succeeding,
every day seemed to make
it less and less probable that his predictions
could be verified. The
Bourbon star was lost in the sun of
Austerlitz. The Republic itself was
forgotten; the Pope inaugurated the
Empire; Austria gave him a princess,
to be the mould of a dynasty, and the
source of a new legitimacy. France
was peopled with a generation that
never knew the Bourbons, and which
was dazzled with the genius of Napoleon,
and the splendour of his imperial
government. But the time came
for this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">puissance occulte, cette justice
du ciel</i>! When the Allies entered
Paris in 1814, it was suggested to
Napoleon that the Bourbons would
be restored; and, with all his sagacity,
he made the very mistake which de
Maistre had foreshown, and said, in
almost his very words&mdash;"Never!
nine-tenths of the people are irreconcilably
against it!" One can almost
hear what might have been the Count's
reply&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle pitié! le peuple n'est
pour rien dans les revolutions. Quatre
ou cinq personnes, peut-être, donneront
un roi à la France.</i>" What could
Talleyrand tell about that? The
facts were, that in four days the
Bourbons were all the rage! The
Place Vendôme could hardly hold the
mob that raved about Napoleon's
statue; and, with ropes and pulleys,
they were straining every sinew to
drag it to the ground, when it was
taken under the protection of Alexander!<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
What next? In terror for
his very life, this Napoleon flies to
Frejus, now sneaking out of a back-window,
and now riding post, as a
common courier, actually saving himself
by wearing the white cockade
over his raging breast, and all the
time cursing his dear French to Tartarus!
A British vessel gives him his
only asylum, and the salute he receives
from a generous enemy is all
that reminds him what he once had
been in France. Meantime these detested
Bourbons are welcomed home
again, with De Maistre's own varieties
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive-le-roi</i>! The Duke d'Angouleme,
advancing to the capital, sees
the silver lilies dancing above the
spires of Bordeaux: the Count
d'Artois hails the same tokens at
Nancy: not captains and lieutenants,
but generals and marshals, rush to
receive His Most Christian Majesty;
and the successor of the butchered
Louis XVI. comes to his palace, after
an exile of twenty years, with the
title of Louis the Desired! Nor are
subsequent events anything more
than the swinging of a pendulum,
which must eventually subside into a
plummet. If the first disaster of Napoleon,
in the fulness of his strength,
could make France welcome her legitimacy
in 1814, why should not the
imbecility of the mere shadow of his
name produce a stronger revulsion
before this century gains its meridian?
There is a residuary fulfilment of de
Maistre's augury, which remains to
the Bourbons, when all of Napoleon
that survives has found its ignominious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
extinction. Then will the ripe
fruit fall into the lap of one who, if
he is wise, will make the French forget
his kindred with the fourteenth
and fifteenth Louises, and remember
only that Henry of Bordeaux has
before him the example of Henry of
Navarre.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, another conceivable
end. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est l'arrêt que le ciel prononce
enfin contre les peuples sans
jugement, et rebelles à l'expérience.</i><a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
If France does not soon come back to
reason, we shall be forced to think
her given up of <span class="smcap">God</span>, to become such
a country as Germany, or perhaps as
miserable as Spain. But we must
not be too hasty in coming to conclusions
so deplorable. Let the republic
have its day. It will work its
own cure; for the chastisement of
France must be the curse of ancient
Judah. "The people shall be oppressed,
every one by another, and
everyone by his neighbour; the child
shall behave himself proudly against
the ancient, and the base against the
honourable." For the mob of Paris,
who got drunk with riot, and must
grow sober with headache; for the
blousemen and the boys who have
pulled a house upon their head, and
now maul each other in painful efforts
to get from under the ruins; and for
the miserable <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">philosophes</i> who see, in
the charming state of their country,
the fruit of their own atheistic theories;
for all these it is but retribution.
They needed government; they resolved
on license: <span class="smcap">God</span> has sent them
despotism in its worst form. One
pities Paris, but feels that it is just.
My emotions are very different when
I think of what were once "the pleasant
villages of France." Miserable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">campagnards</i>! There are thousands
of them, besides the poor souls starving
in provincial towns, who curse
the republic in their hearts; and,
from Normandy to Provence and
Languedoc, there are millions of such
Frenchmen, who care nothing for
dynasties, or fraternities, or democracy,
but only pray the good Lord to
give peace in their time, that they
may sit under their own vine, and
earn and eat their daily bread. For
them&mdash;may <span class="smcap">God</span> pity them!&mdash;what a
life Dame Paris leads them! If, with
the simplicity of rustics, they were
for a moment disposed to be merry
last February&mdash;when they heard that
thereafter loaves and fishes were to
fling themselves upon every table, for
the mere pleasure of being devoured&mdash;how
bitterly the simpletons are undeceived!
Their present notions of
fraternity and equality they get from
hunger and from rags. It is not now
in France as in the days of Henry
IV., when every peasant had a pullet
in the pot for his Sunday dinner.
That was despotism. It is liberty
now&mdash;liberty to starve. There is no
more oppression, for the very looms
refuse to work, and water-wheels
stand still; and the vines go gadding
and unpruned, and the grape disdains
to be trampled in the wine-vat. Yes&mdash;and
the old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paysan</i> and his sprightly
dame, who used to drive dull care
away in the sunshine&mdash;she, with her
shaking foot and head, and he with
his fiddle and his bow, they have
liberty to the full; for their seven
sons, who were earning food for them
in the sweat of their brow, have come
home to the old cabin, ragged and
unpaid; and they lounge about in
hungry idleness, longing for war, but
only because war would provide them
with a biscuit or a bullet. What care
they for glory, or for constitutions?
They ask for bread, and their teeth
are ground with gravel-stones. Let
England look and learn. If she has
troubles, let her see how easily troubles
may be invested at compound interest,
with the certainty of dividends for
years to come. Is hard thrift in a
kingdom so bad as starvation in a
democracy? And whether is it better
to wear out honestly, in this work-day
world, as good and quiet subjects;
or to be thrust out of it, kicking and
cursing, behind a barricade of cabs
and paving-stones, in the name of
equality? These are the common-sense
questions, that every English
labourer should be made to feel and
answer.</p>

<p>It provokes me, Basil, that my letter
may be superannuated while it is
travelling in the steamer! The
changes of democracy are more frequent
than the revolutions of a paddle-wheel.
Adieu. Yours,</p>

<h2>DALMATIA AND MONTENEGRO.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><cite>Dalmatia and Montenegro.</cite> By Sir <span class="smcap">J. Gardner Wilkinson</span>. London: Murray.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is really astonishing that our
want of information respecting Dalmatia,
and its neighbourhood, has not
long ago been supplied. It is by no
means easy, now-a-days, to hit upon
a line of country that may afford subject-matter
for acceptable illustration.
Travellers are so numerous, and
authorship is so generally affected,
that the best part of Europe has been
described over and over again. You
may get from Mr Murray a handbook
for almost any place you will.
Manners and customs, roads, inns,
things to be suffered, and notabilities
to be visited&mdash;in short, all the probable
contingencies of travel between
this and the Vistula, are already noted
and set down. We take it upon ourselves
to say, that it is one of the most
difficult things in life to realise the
sense of desolation and unwontedness
that are poetic characteristics of the
traveller. How can a man feel himself
strange to any place where he is
so thoroughly up to usages that no
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">locandière</i> can cheat him to the amount
of a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zwanziger</i>? And, thanks to the
books written, it is a man's own fault
if he wend almost anywhither except
thus μύστης γενόμενος.</p>

<p>In truth, European travelling is
pretty nearly reduced to the work
of verification. Events are according
to prescription; and there remains
very little room for the play of
an exploring spirit. The grand thing
to be explored is a matter pysychological
rather than material; it is to
prove experimentally what are the
emotions that a generous mind experiences,
when vividly acted upon by
association with the world of past
existences. Beyond doubt, this is the
highest range of intellectual enjoyment;
and to its province may be
referred much that at first sight would
appear to be heterogeneous, as, for instance,
delights purely scientific. But
at any rate, we must all agree that the
main privilege of a traveller is, that
he is enabled to test the force of this
power of association. It is an enjoyment
to be known only by experiment.
No power of description can
give a man to understand what is the
sensation of gazing on the Acropolis,
or of standing within Ἁγία Σοφία. It
is as another sense, called into existence
by the occasion of exercise.</p>

<p>To any but the uncommonly well
read, there has hitherto been meagre
entertainment in travelling among the
Slavonian borderers on the Adriatic.
It has been impossible to realise on
their subject these high pleasures of
association, because so little has been
known of the facts of their history;
rather should we perhaps say, that, of
what has been known, so little has
been generally accessible. But we
are happy to find that the right sort
o' "chiel has been amang them, takin'
notes." The way is now open; and
henceforth it will be easy to follow
with profit. The book which Sir
Gardner Wilkinson has given us
seems to be exactly the thing which
was wanted; and certainly the use
of it will enable a man to travel in
Dalmatia as a rational creature should.
No mere dotter down of events could
have passed through the course of
this country without producing a
document of considerable value. The
widespread family of which its inhabitants
are a branch have been intimately
mixed up with the history of the
Empire and of Christendom; and now
again we behold them playing a conspicuous
part in European politics. Modern
Panslavism deepens the interest to
be felt in this family, and quickens the
anxiety to know what they are doing
and thinking now, as well as what
they have done in days of old. In
the present volumes we have, besides
the memoranda of things existing, a
compendium of Slavonian history and
antiquities, and an exhibition of the
degree in which the race have been mixed
up with European history. Besides
this, an account is given of their more
domestic traditions, of which monuments
survive; and it must be a man's
own fault if, having this book with
him, he miss extracting the utmost
of profit from a visit to the country.</p>

<p>In one way, we can surely prophesy
that this book will prove the means
of bringing to us increase of lore from
out of that land of which it treats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
It will naturally be taken on board
every yacht that, when next summer
shall open skies and seas, may find its
way into the Mediterranean. Among
these birds of passage, it can scarcely be
but that some one will shape its course
for this land of adventure, thus, as it
were, newly laid open. It is a little, a
very little out of the direct track, in
which these summer craft are apt to be
found, plentiful as butterflies. They
may rest assured that in no place,
from the Pillars of Hercules to the
Pharos of Alexandria, can they hope
to find such provision of entertainment.
The stories they may thence
bring will really be worth something&mdash;a
value much higher than we can vote
ascribable to much that we hear of
the well-frequented shores of the
French lake.</p>

<p>We prophesy, also, that an inspiriting
effect will be produced on men
better qualified even than the yachtsmen
for the work of travel&mdash;we
mean on the gallant officers who garrison
the island of Corfu. They
occupy a station so exactly calculated
to facilitate excursions in the desirable
direction, that it will be too bad
if some of them do not start this
very next spring. We do not recommend
the Adriatic in winter time, and
so give them a few months' grace,
just to keep clear of the Bora. Let
them, as soon as possible after the
equinox, avail themselves of one of
those gaps which will be occurring in
the best-regulated garrison life.
Times will come round when duty
makes no exaction, and when the
indigenous resources of the island
afford no amusement. Should such
occasion have place out of the shooting
months&mdash;or when, haply, some
row with the Albanians has placed
Butrinto under interdict&mdash;woful are
the straits to which our ardent young
fellow-countrymen are reduced. A
ride to the Garoona pass, or a lounge
into Carabots; or, to come to the
worst, an hour or two's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flané</i> round
old Schulenberg's statue, are well in
their way, but cannot please for ever.
All these things considered, it is, we
say, but likely that we shall reap
some substantial benefit from the
leisure of our military friends, so
soon as their literary researches shall
have carried them into the enjoyment
of this book. Dalmatia is almost
before their very eyes. If hitherto
they have not drifted thither, under
the combined influences of a long
leave and an uncertain purpose, it is
because they have not been in a condition
to prosecute researches. We
must not blame them for their past
neglect, any more than we blame the
idleness of him who lacks the implements
of work. Give a man tools, and
then, if he work not, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monstrare digito</i>.
Henceforth they must be regarded as
thoroughly equipped, and without excuse.
Let us hope that some two or
three may be roused to action on the
very next opportunity&mdash;that is to say,
on the very next occasion of leave.
Let us hope that, instead of sloping
away to Paxo, or Santa Maura, they
may shape their course through the
North Channel, and begin, if they
please, by exploring the Bocca di
Cattaro.</p>

<p>Sir Gardner speaks of difficulties
and vexatious delays interposed between
the traveller and his purpose
by the Austrian authorities. These
scrutineers of passports seem to grow
worse; and with them bad has long
been the best. We used to think
that the palm of pettifogging was
fairly due to the officials of his Hellenic
majesty. It was bad enough,
we always thought, to be kept waiting
and watching for a license to move
from the Piræus to Lutraki, by steam;
but we confess that Sir Gardner
makes out a case, or rather several
cases, that beat our experience hollow.
We should like to commit the
passport system to the verdict to be
pronounced by common-sense after
perusal of the two or three pages he
has written on this subject. But common-sense
must be far from us, or the
mob would not be raving for liberty
while still tolerant of passports.</p>

<p>There is another point in respect of
which a change for the worse appears
to have taken place, and that is in
the important point of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bienveillance</i>
towards English travellers. We learn
that, at present, Austrian officers are
shy of English companionship; and
that it is even enjoined on them authoritatively
that they avoid intimacy
with stragglers from Corfu. The
reason assignable is found in the late
sad and absurd conspiracy hatched in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
that island&mdash;a conspiracy which would
have been utterly ridiculous, had it
not in the event proved so melancholy.
It will freely be admitted that
the English would deserve to be sent,
as they are, to Coventry, were it fact
that the insane project of the young
Bandieras had found English partisans,
and that such partisanship had
been winked at by the authorities.
But the real state of the case is exactly
contrary to this supposition.
Humanity must needs have mourned
over the cutting off of the young men,
and the sorrow of their father, the
gallant old admiral. But common-sense
must have condemned the undertaking
as utterly absurd and mischievous.
It is a pity that any
misunderstanding should be permitted
to qualify the good feeling towards us,
for which the Austrians have been
remarkable. This good feeling has
been observable eminently among
their naval officers, who have got up
a strong fellowship with us, ever
since they were associated with our
fleet in the operations on the coast of
Syria. That particular service has done
much towards the exalting of them in
their own estimation; and, of course,
the increase of friendship for us has
been in the direct proportion of the
lift given to them. The Austrian
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">militaires</i>, also, used to be a very good
set of fellows, and only too happy to
be civil to an Englishman. At their
dull stations an arrival is an event,
and any considerable accession of
visitors occasions quite a jubilee.
These gentlemen, however, cannot
have among them much of the spirit
of enterprise, or they would take
more trouble than they do to learn
something of the condition of their
neighbours. They will complain
freely of the dulness of the place of
their location, but at the same time
will evince little interest in the condition
of the world beyond their immediate
ken. Many of them who
live almost within hail of the Montenegrini,
have never been at the
trouble of ascending the mountains.
Nothing seems to astonish them more
than the erratic disposition which
leads men in quest of adventure;
they cannot conceive such an idea as
that of volunteering for a cruise. Yachts
puzzle them: the owners must be
sailors. Of any military officers who
may chance to visit them in yachts,
they cannot conceive otherwise than
that they belong to the marine.
Nevertheless they are, or used to be,
kind and hospitable; and would treat
you well, although they could not
quite make you out.</p>

<p>That this country is a neglected
portion of the Austrian empire is very
evident. The officials sigh under the
very endearments of office. The
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sanità</i> man, who comes off to greet
your arrival, will tell you how insufferably
dull it is living in the Bocca,&mdash;and
how he longs to be removed
anywhither. Place, people, climate,
all will be condemned. Yet, to a
stranger, many of the localities seem
exquisitely beautiful. The same cause
seems to mar enjoyment here that
spoils the beauty of our own Norfolk
Island. The Austrian residents regard
themselves as being in a state of
banishment, and take up their abode
only by constraint: the constraint, that
is to say, of mammon. By the government,
its possessions in this quarter
have been neglected in a manner most
impolitic. The value of this strip of
coast to an empire almost entirely
inland, yet wishing to foster trade,
and to possess a navy, is obvious.
Yet even the plainest use of it they
seem, till lately, to have missed.
Promiscuous conscriptions were the
order of the day, and men born sailors
were enrolled in the levies for the
army. Of course they were miserable
and discontented, and the public service
suffered by the use of these unfit
instruments. Recently it seems that
a change has been made in this
respect, and we doubt not that the
navy has consequently been greatly
improved. But many glaring instances
of neglect in the administration of
the affairs of the country continue to
astonish beholders, and to prove that
the paternal government is not awake
to its own interests.</p>

<p>But of all objections to be made
to the wisdom of the government,
the strongest may be grounded on
the condition of the agricultural population
in various parts of Dalmatia.
Nothing is done to improve their knowledge
of the primary art of civilisation.
Their implements of husbandry
are described as being on a par with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
those used by the unenlightened inhabitants
of Asia Minor. The waggons
to be encountered in the neighbourhood
of Knin are referable to
the same date in the progress of invention,
as are the conveniences in
vogue in the plains about Mount Ida.
The mode of tillage is like that followed
in the remote provinces of
Turkey; the ploughs of the rustic
population are often inferior to those
to be seen in the neighbouring Turkish
provinces. Lastly&mdash;most incredible
of all!&mdash;we learn that there is not to
be found in the whole district of the
Narenta such a thing as a mill,
wherein to grind their corn. Will it
be believed that the rustics have to
send all the corn they grow into
the neighbouring province of Herzegovina
to be ground? The inconvenience
of such an arrangement
may easily be conceived. Their best
of the bargain&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> the being obliged
to seek from across the frontier all
the flour they want&mdash;is bad enough,
and must be sufficiently expensive;
but their predicament is apt to be
much worse than this. In that
part of the world, people are subject
to stoppages of intercommunication.
The plague may break out in the
Turkish province, and thus a strict
quarantine be established, to the interdiction
even of provisions that
generally pass unsuspected; or the
country may be flooded, and the ways
impassable. What are the poor people
to do then for flour? Why, the
only thing they can do is, to send their
corn to their nearest neighbours possessed
of mills&mdash;that is to say, to
Salona, or to Imoschi. As these places
are distant, the one about thirty-five
miles, and the other about seventy
miles, we may fancy how serious must
be the pressure of this necessity.
The ordinary expense of grinding
their corn is stated to be about 13
per cent. What it must be when the
seventy miles' carriage of their produce
is an item in the calculation, we
are left to conjecture. Now these
poor folks are not to be blamed&mdash;they
have no funds to enable them to build
mills; but that they are left to themselves
in this inability is a reproach
to the government under which they
live. This inconvenience so intimately
affects their social wellbeing,
that we cannot put faith in the benevolence
of the rulers who allow them
to remain so destitute.</p>

<p>Despite, however, of the disadvantages
under which the people of Dalmatia
labour, it will be seen that
pictures chiefly pleasurable are to be
met by him who shall travel amongst
them. Their honest nature seems to
comprise within itself some compensating
principle, which makes amends
for the damage of circumstances. The
Morlacci, especially, seem to be a
simple, hardy set, of whom one cannot
read without pleasure. These are the
rustic inhabitants of the agricultural
districts, who eschew the great towns.
They made their entry into the roll
of the peasantry of Dalmatia at a
comparatively late date. The first
notice of them, we are told, is about
the middle of the fourteenth century.
After that time they began to retire
with their families from Bosnia, as
the Turks made advances into the
country. They are of the same Slavonic
family as the Croatians; though
their hardy manner of life, and the
purity of the air in which they have
dwelt, on the mountains, have co-operated
to confer on them superiority of
personal appearance, and of physical
condition. On a general estimate of
the people of the land, and of their
mode of receiving strangers, we
are disposed to rank highly their
claims to the title of hospitable and
honest.</p>

<p>Sir Gardner Wilkinson certainly
travelled amongst them most effectually.
North, south, east, and west,
he intersected the country. One part
of his travels possesses especial interest,
because, so far as we know, no
denizen of civilised Christendom has
ever before been so completely over
the ground. We refer to his expedition
into, and through the territory of the
Montenegrini. Others&mdash;some few
only, but still some others&mdash;have been
far enough to get a peep at these
wild children of the mountains; and
more than once of late years, Maga
has given notices concerning them:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
but only scanty knowledge of their
domestic condition has been attainable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Sir Gardner went right through their
country to the Turkish border, and
tarried amongst them long enough to
form pretty accurate notions of their
state.
.
In the account of our author's first
journey, no serious stop is made till we
come alongside of the island of Veglia:
apropos to the passage by which, we
have given to us, at some length, an
interesting extract from the report of
a Venetian commissioner sent to the
island, in 1481, to inquire into its
state. Of this document we will say
no more than that it is exceedingly
curious, and will well reward the pains
of reading. A passing notice is given
to Segna, situated on the mainland,
near Veglia, for the memory's sake of
those desperate villains the Uscocs, to
whom it belonged of old. A good
deal of their history is given in the
last chapter of the second volume,
which serves as a documentary appendix
to the work. Everything necessary
to beget interest in the islands
scattered hereaway is told; but we
pass them by, and are brought to Zara.
What of antiquities is here discoverable
is rooted out for our benefit, but
not much remains. The most interesting
relic in the place, to our mind,
is the inscription recording the victory
of Lepanto. As Zara is the capital
of Dalmatia, occasion is taken, while
speaking of the city, to give some
account of the government of the
province, and of the general condition
of the people.</p>

<p>An incident mentioned by Sir Gardner
displays, in a painful light, the kind
of feeling entertained by the Austrian
government towards these its subjects,
and permitted by its officials to find
expression before the natives. We
cannot take it as a case of isolated
insolence: because men in responsible
situations, especially where the social
system comprises an indefinite supply
of spies, do not ostentatiously commit
themselves, unless they have a foregone
conviction, that what they say
is according to the authorised tone.
Men under inspection of the higher
powers do not put themselves out of
their way to make a display of bitterness,
unless they think thereby to conciliate
the good-will of their superiors.
This is the incident in question: On
a certain occasion, the conversation
happened to turn on the subject of a
then recent disturbance in a Dalmatian
town. The soldiery and the
people had quarrelled, and in the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">émeute</i> two of the soldiers had been
killed. On these data forth spake a
Jack in office. He knew not, nor did
he care to know, how many of the
peasants had fallen, nor does he appear
to have entered at all curiously
into the question of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casus belli</i>. He
simply recommended, as the disturbance
had taken place, and as the actual
perpetrators of the violence were not
forthcoming, that the whole population
of the town should be "decimated
and shot." "The butchery of any
number of Dalmatians," says our author,
"was thought a fit way of remedying
the incapacity of the police."
One would hardly imagine that this
counsel could have been met by the
applauses of persons holding official
situations; but so, we are assured, it
was in fact received. This manifestation
of feeling is a sort of thing
which, when emanating from a group
of merely private individuals, may be
disregarded. Idle people will talk, and
their hard words will break no bones.
But the hard words of the ministers of
government do break bones; and
such words must be accepted as
serious indications of subsistent evil.
Such receipts for keeping people in
peace and quietness are consistent
enough with the genius of their neighbours
the Turks. Retrenchment of
heads, and of causes of complaint, are
to their apprehension one and the same
thing&mdash;πολλων ὀνομάτων, μορφὴ μία.
We know this, and expect it. It is
not so very long ago since the Capitan
Pasha gave the word to heave
the officer of the watch overboard,
because his ship missed stays in going
about in the Black Sea. But the
Austrians are civilised and Christian;
we expect better things of them, and
can but mourn over their misapprehension
of the true principles of
polity. The Englishman who stood
by rebuked the promoters of these
atrocious sentiments, and for this act
of championship he was subsequently
thanked by the Dalmatians who
were present. They could not have
ventured to undertake their own defence,
but must have listened in
silence to this outrageous language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Our author doubts not that this exhibition
of simple humanity on his part,
had the effect of causing him to be
forthwith placed under the surveillance
of the police; and that such a
consequence should be so very likely
to follow the honest expression of a
common-sense opinion in society is a
fact that shows clearly enough how
<em>unsound</em> that state of things must be.
Assuredly one of the best effects of
intercourse with civilised nations is,
that we thereby become enabled to
institute a comparison between their
social condition and our own. Even
those unhappy Chartists, who lately
have acquired the habit of addressing
one another as "brother slaves,"
would learn to value British freedom,
if they knew something of the social
condition of their European brethren:
they would see some difference between
the security of their own hours
of relaxation, and the degree in which
a man's freedom in Austria is invaded
by the espionage of the police.</p>

<p>From Zara the course of the narrative
takes us to Sebenico, a town
situated on the inner side of the lake
or bay into which the waters of the
Kerka debouch. It is one of the
coaling stations of the steamer; and,
when the time of arrival will allow
such concession, the passengers are
permitted to take a trip in a four-oared
boat, to visit the falls of the
Kerka. Here the costume of the
women is noticed as being singularly
graceful. In coasting along from
Sebenico to Spalato, the headland of
la Planca is remarkable. Near it is
a little church which is famous in
local chronicle for having once upon
a time served as a trap, wherein an
ass caught a wolf. How this marvellous
feat was accomplished, we will
not just now stop to tell, but must
refer the curious to the book itself.
This point is also remarkable, because
here begins abruptly a change in the
climate. Some plants unknown to
the northward begin to appear; and
henceforward, to one proceeding
southward, the dreaded Scirocco will
be a more frequent infliction. To
the southward of la Planca, this
objectionable wind is constantly blowing;
and at Spalato, we are told, it
assumes for its allowance 100 days
out of the 365. Apropos to the Scirocco,
we have an episode on <em>anemology</em>,
and are taught how the old
Greeks and Romans used to box the
compass&mdash;at least how they would
have done so, had they had compasses
to box. In the distance, to
the south of the promontory of la
Planca, is the island of Lissa, famous
in modern history for Sir William
Hoste's action in 1811. "Such an
action," says James, "stands unrivalled
in the annals of the naval
history of Great Britain, or that of
any other country, from the great
disproportion in numerical force, as
well as the beauty and address of its
man&oelig;uvres; it stands surpassed by
none in the spirit and enterprise with
which it was encountered, and carried
through to a successful issue."
There is not much risk in making this
assertion, when we consider that on
that occasion the French squadron
consisted of four forty-gun frigates,
two of a smaller class, a sixteen-gun
corvette, a ten-gun schooner, one six-gun
xebec, and two gunboats; and
that the English squadron was of
three frigates, and one twenty-two
gunship. Lissa was also famous in
the time of the Romans, being then
called Issa. We have a notice of its
history, and then pass on to Bua,
and so to Spalato.</p>

<p>Concerning Spalato details are given,
as might be expected, at some length.
Much is told us of its past and present
condition; in fact, there is presented
to us a very sufficient assemblage of
<em>indicia</em> concerning it. We recommend
any one who wishes to enjoy a
visit to Spalato to take with him this
book, and chapter 13th of Gibbon.
The extract from Porphyrogenitus,
given by Gibbon, tells us what the
palace of Diocletian was; and Sir
Gardner Wilkinson tells us what it is
now, and what has been its history.
Besides verbal description, his pencil
affords some apt illustrations of the
actual condition of the buildings. We
see by these, and by his account, that
the treasures of Spalatine architecture
have been obscured by the building
up of modern edifices on their sites.
"The stranger," he says, "is shocked
to see windows of houses through the
arches of the court, intercolumniations
filled up with petty shops, and the
peristyle of the great temple masked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
by modern houses." Doubtless, many
a precious relic has been appropriated
by modern barbarians to common
uses, and so perished out of sight. But
with joy we learn that the government
has taken measures to prevent the
continuance of such destruction, and
that the remaining monuments are
safe, however they may be mixed up
with the houses and shops of the present
generation. We are told that,
under the care of the present director
of antiquarian researches, there is good
reason to hope that the collection at
Spalato may become truly valuable.
The high character of Professor
Carrara is a sure warrant that all will
be done which is within scope of the
means afforded. But as the government
allowance for excavations at
Salona is only £80 yearly, we cannot
think that the work is likely to
proceed rapidly. While we condemn
as barbarous this carelessness on the
part of the Austrians, we must bear in
mind that we are open to a retort of
the censure. We neglect altogether
the remains of Samos in Cephalonia,
and nothing at all is allowed for the
expense of operations there; yet
these remains are very extensive, and
there is every reason to believe that
their actual condition would amply repay
a diligent search.</p>

<p>We must stop here a moment to
congratulate Sir Gardner, on his rencontre
with the sphinx.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A captive when he gazes on the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">and so forth, are the only people who
may venture to talk of Sir Gardner's
delight at the sight of a sphinx, or a
mummy. With great gusto he gives
the description of the black granite
sphinx, in the court of the palace, near
the vestibule; and in the drawing
which he has made of the same court,
the sphinx is conspicuous.</p>

<p>From Spalato to Salona, is a distance
of some three miles and a half,
by a good carriage-road. This road
crosses the Jader, or Il Giadro&mdash;a
stream so famous for its trout, that it
has been thought necessary seriously
to prove that it was <em>not</em> for the sake
of these&mdash;not in order that of them he
might eat his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soûl</i> in peace and
quietness&mdash;that Diocletian retired from
the command of the world.</p>

<p>Salona is rich in antiquarian remains,
though nothing is extant to
redeem from improbability the testimony
of Porphyrogenitus, that Salona
was half the size of Constantinople. Of
its origin no record exists, nor is
much known of its history till the time
of Julius Cæsar. Subsequently to that
era it was subject to various fortunes,
and bore various titles. At last, in
Christian times it became a Bishop's
see, and was occupied by 61 bishops
in succession. Diocletian was its
great embellisher and almost rebuilder.
Later in the day, we find that it was
from Salona that Belisarius set out in
544, when recalled to the command of
the army of Justinian, and intrusted
with the conduct of the war against
Totila. The town remained populous
and fortified, till destroyed by the
Avars in 639. These ferocious barbarians
having established themselves
in Clissa, the terror of their propinquity
scared away the Salonitans. The
terrified inhabitants, after a short and
ineffectual resistance, fled to the
islands. The town was pillaged and
burnt, and from that time Salona has
been deserted and in ruins.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With these historical facts before us,
it is interesting to observe the present
state of the place, which affords many
illustrations of past events. The positions
of its defences, repaired at various times,
may be traced: an inscription lately discovered
by Professor Carrara, shows that
its walls and towers were repaired by
Valentinian II., and Theodosius; and the
ditch of Constantianus is distinctly seen
on the north side. Here and there, it has
been filled up with earth and cultivated;
but its position cannot be mistaken, and
in places its original breadth may be
ascertained. A very small portion of the
wall remains on the east side, and nearly
all traces of it are lost towards the river:
but the northern portion is well preserved,
and the triangular front, or salient
angle of many of its towers, may be
traced.</p>

<p>"In the western part of the town are
the theatre, and what is called the amphitheatre.
Of the former, some portion of
the proscenium remains, as well as the
solid tiers of arches, built of square
stone, with bevelled edges, about 6&frac14; feet
diameter, and 10 feet apart."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have a good description of the
annual fair of Salona. The description
will be suggestive of picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
recollections to those who have seen
the open air festivities celebrated by
the orthodox&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> by the children of
the Greek Church, about Easter time.
We can take it upon ourselves to recommend
highly the lambs, wont to be
roasted whole on these occasions.
The culinary apparatus is rude&mdash;consisting
merely of a few sticks for a fire,
and another stick to be used as a spit&mdash;but
the result of their operations is
most satisfactory.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All Spalato is of course at the fair;
and the road to Salona is thronged with
carriages of every description, horsemen,
and pedestrians. The mixture of the
men's hats, red caps, and turbans, and
the bonnets and Frank dresses of the
Spalatine ladies, contrasted with the
costume of the country women, presents
one of the most singular sights to be soon
in Europe, and to a stranger the language
adds in no small degree to the novelty.
Some business is done as well as pleasure;
and a great number of cattle, sheep, and
pigs are bought and sold&mdash;as well as
various stuffs, trinkets, and the usual
goods exhibited at fairs. Long before
mid-day, the groups of peasants have
thronged the road, not to say street, of
Salona; some attend the small church,
picturesquely placed upon a green, surrounded
by the small streams of the
Giadro, and shaded with trees; while
others rove about, seeking their friends,
looking at, and looked at by strangers, as
they pass; and all are intent on the
amusements of the day, and the prospect
of a feast.</p>

<p>"Eating and drinking soon begin. On
all sides sheep are seen roasting whole on
wooden spits, in the open air; and an
entire flock is speedily converted into
mutton. Small knots of hungry friends
are formed in every direction: some
seated on a bank beneath the trees,
others in as many houses as will hold
them; some on grass by the road-side,
regardless of sun and dust&mdash;and a few
quiet families have boats prepared for
their reception.</p>

<p>"In the mean time, the hat-wearing
townspeople from Spalato and other places,
as they pace up and down, bowing to an
occasional acquaintance, view with complacent
pity the primitive recreations of
the simple peasantry; and arm-in-arm,
civilisation, with its propriety and affectation,
is here strangely contrasted with
the hearty laugh of the unrefined Morlacchi."</p></blockquote>

<p>We do not know the country where
men will meet together and eat without
drinking also: at the al-fresco
entertainments of this kind which we
have seen, the kegs of wine have ever
been in goodly proportion to the spitted
lambs. And wherever a mob of men
set to drinking together, they will most
assuredly take to fighting. The rows
at this fair used to be considerable;
and, considering that more wine is
said to be consumed here on this one
day than during the whole of the rest
of the year, we cannot be surprised
that fights should come off worthy of
Donnybrook. At present, better order
is preserved than of old, because these
rows have been so excessive that they
have enforced the attendance of the
police.</p>

<p>At this fair is to be seen the picturesque
<em>collo</em> dance of the Morlacchi,
of which our author affords a capital
pencil-sketch, as well as the following
description:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It sometimes begins before dinner,
but is kept up with greater spirit afterwards.
They call it <em>collo</em>, from being,
like most of their national dances, in a
circle. A man generally has one partner,
sometimes two, but always at his right
side. In dancing, he takes her right
hand with his, while she supports herself
by holding his girdle with her left; and
when he has two partners, the one nearest
him holds in her right hand that of her
companion, who, with her left, takes the
right hand of the man; and each set
dances forward in a line round the circle.
The step is rude, as in most of the Slavonic
dances, including the polka and the
<em>radovatschka</em>; and the music, which is
primitive, is confined to a three-stringed
violin."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dancing for dancing's sake, is what
enters into no Englishman's category
of the enjoyable, nor into many an
Englishwoman's either, we should
think, after the passage out of her
teens; but that it is, in sober earnest,
an enjoyment to many people under
the sun, there is no doubt. Surely
there is something wonderful in the
faculty of finding pleasure in the elephantine
man&oelig;uvres of the <em>romaika</em>,
or in the still more clumsy gyrations
of a <i>palicari's</i> performance. The <i>collo</i>
we readily believe to be a picturesque
dance: but such qualification is not
the general condition on which the
people of a nation accept dances as
national. Most of these exhibitions
in Greece and Eastern Europe must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
condemned as graceless and unmeaning:
as an exhibition of earnest tomfoolery,
they may be accepted as wonderful;
and, at all events, may safely
be pronounced co-excellent with the
music that inspires them.</p>

<p>In passing from Salona to Traü, a
distance of about thirteen miles and a
half to the westward, the traveller
passes by several of the villages called
Castelli. The name has been given
them from the circumstance of their
having been built near to, and under
the protection of, the castles which,
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
were constructed here by some of the
nobles.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The land was granted to them by the
Venetians, on condition of their erecting
places of refuge for the peasants during
the wars with the Turks. A body of
armed men lived within them, and, on
the approach of danger, the flocks and
herds were protected beneath the walls;
and, at harvest time, the peasantry had a
place of security for their crops within
range of the castle guns."</p></blockquote>

<p>The rights of lordship over the villages,
which used to be exercised by
the nobles in virtue of the protection
afforded, have nearly all fallen into
disuse. The only relic of feudalism
that seems to survive is found at Castel
Cambio, over which two nobles still
possess certain rights. One of these
was the hospitable host of Sir Gardner,
and his friend Professor Carrara, on
their passage to and from Traü.</p>

<p>A fact connected with the peculiarity
of the position of this town
is, we think, well worthy of notice,
and deservedly recorded by our author.
The town stands partly on a
peninsula, and partly on the island
of Bua. A fosse, cut across the
narrow neck of the peninsula, has
completed its isolation. This ditch
has proved, on occasion, the most
effectual of fortifications to the Traürines.
They were, in 1241, besieged
by the Tartars in pursuit of King
Bela IV., who had fled hither before
them. These impetuous assailants
were unable to pass the ditch; and,
having waited on the other side till
food and forage were exhausted, they
were obliged to retire. One cannot
read this story without thinking of the
account that Sir Francis Head gives
of the La Plata Indians, whose habits
of warfare are in many respects so exactly
akin to those of the Tartars.
These terrific horsemen would be
scarcely resistible by their less robust
enemies, save for their inability to cross
anything in the shape of a ditch. Out
of the saddle they can do nothing,
and their horses will not leap; so that,
if you wish to be safe from their inroads,
you have but to surround your
dwellings with a moderate trench.
And very striking is the story that
Sir Francis Head tells of the handful
of men who, under such protection,
held out successfully against a host of
Indians. Traü, however, has been
elaborately fortified in European fashion,
though now the works are neglected,
as being a useless precaution
against dangers no longer existent.
It has also a fine old cathedral, and
some pictures of pretension.</p>

<p>After a brief notice of the islands of
Brazza and Solta&mdash;a notice, however,
sufficient for all useful purposes&mdash;we
pass on to the picturesque neighbourhood
of the falls of the Kerka. Sir
Gardner speaks of the delay to which
the passage by boat from Sebenico to
Scardona is subject, but does not exactly
complain of it. In fact, we can
easily understand that, for the sake of
the passenger, it is expedient that
some authoritative note should be
taken of his departure under charge
of the particular boatmen who undertake
his convoy. We never did ascend
to Kerka, but from what we have
seen of the class of men under whose
guidance the expedition has to be performed,
we are disposed to vote the
caution of the police to be anything but
superfluous. Every now and then one
hears dreadful stories of the atrocities
of boatmen in convenient parts of the
Mediterranean; and there is good
reason to be thankful that the Austrians
think it worth while to be so
careful of strangers.</p>

<p>The people about Sebenico, through
whose lands the course of the lake
leads, are spoken of as not paying
much attention to agriculture or to
their fisheries; but it seems that they
are sedulously bent on raising grapes,
and neglect no patch of ground at all
likely to be available for this purpose.
The lake of Scardona is considerably
larger than that of Sebenico. On the
shore here the Romans had a settlement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of which scarcely any remains
are perceptible. They are, however,
remarkable as affording a manifest
proof of the rise of the level of the
lake, for some of them are under
water.</p>

<p>Scardona, we are told, does not occupy
the site of the old Scardon,
which was a place of considerable importance
under the empire. Some have
even imagined that the old city stood
on the opposite bank of the river.
The town at present is small, but well
furnished for the convenience of strangers.
It boasts an inn, at which Sir
Gardner put up for one night. He
then proceeded to the falls, which are
distant from the inn a three-quarters-of-an-hour
journey. As he intended
to ascend the river above the falls, he
had to send to the monks of Vissovaz
to ask for a boat, and they readily
complied with his request. The falls
do not seem to have been full on
the occasion of this visit&mdash;but, when
full, the effect must be striking. They
are divided into two parts, and their
picturesque effect is greatly enhanced
by the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>At a distance of a few minutes' walk
up the river, above the falls, the boat
was waiting to transport Sir Gardner
to the convent of Vissovaz. It is to
this fraternity that we have before
alluded, as being the sole mill-owners
on the Kerka. Their convent must
indeed be beautifully situated, and
we can quite enter into the eulogium
bestowed on it. The fathers are of
the Franciscan order. The name of
Vissovaz is of curious allusion; and
as probably few of our courteous
readers will be the worse for a little
help in the matter of Slavonian etymology,
we may as well tell them
that its import is "the place of hanging."
Not a very complimentary or
well-omened name, certainly, we would
think at first sight; but we see that
it is so when we learn that the allusion
is to the martyrdom of two
priests, who were hanged here by the
Turkish governor of Scardona. By
the record left of the event, we cannot
see that the death of these unfortunate
victims was in any sense martyrdom:
they were cruelly and unjustly
put to death, but for a cause
entirely worldly. However, they
were Christians, and their murderers
were Turks; and this has been enough
to constitute a claim to canonisation
in more places than at Vissovaz.</p>

<p>Sir Gardner arrived at the picturesque,
red-tiled convent in time for
dinner; but as the day happened to
be a fast, the fare provided was not
sufficiently tempting to induce a
wish to stay. He therefore was
preparing, with many thanks, to
take his leave of the good fathers,
and proceed on his journey, when
he found himself brought up by
an unexpected difficulty. He was
informed that he could not proceed
except by favour of the monks of the
Greek convent of St Archangelo, another
religious house still farther up
the stream. His hospitable entertainers
readily volunteered to send
in quest of the requisite assistance.
These are the conditions of travelling,
because there are no carriages for hire
hereaway, nor any boats to let. The
Franciscans had volunteered to do
what, when it came to the point, was
found to be rather an awkward thing.
No great cordiality subsists generally
between the Latins and the orthodox.
Each charges the other with destructive
heresy; and doubtless both of
these great branches of the church
esteem a Protestant safe, by comparison
with the arch-heretics that they
each see the other to be. Thus, though
dwelling on the confines of Christendom,
and in a solitude that might
have rendered them neighbourly, we
find that very little intercourse takes
place between the two religious establishments.
Accordingly, the writing
of the letter was found to be no easy
affair; and their guest saw them lay
their heads together in consultation,
after a fashion that boded ill for the
prospects of his journey. They confessed
themselves to be in a fix; and
were afraid of exposing themselves to
some affront if, contrary to their wont,
they should open a communication
with the Greeks, asking of them a
favour.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Did you ever go as far as the convent?'
said an old father to a more
restless and locomotive Franciscan, and
a negative answer seemed to put an end
to the incipient letter; when one of the
party suggested that those Greeks had
shown themselves very civil on some occasion,
and the writer of the epistle once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
more resumed his spectacles and his pen.
'They are,' he observed, 'after all, like ourselves,
and must be glad to see a stranger
who comes from afar; and besides, our
letter may have the effect of commencing a
friendly intercourse with them, which we
may have no reason to regret.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This very sensible hint of the Franciscan
philosopher was happily acted
out. The letter was sent, and in due
course of time&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> in time for a start
next morning&mdash;an answer arrived from
the Archimandrite. It was to welcome
the stranger to their hospitality, and
to inform him that a boat awaited
him at the falls. As the issue on
the first intention was so favourable,
let us hope that the other good results
anticipated from the sending of
the letter will have been by this time
realised. At all events, Sir Gardner
may congratulate himself on having
afforded occasion for the opening of
personal as well as epistolary communication
between the convents, as one
of the Franciscans accompanied him
in the expedition to St Archangelo.</p>

<p>Much praise is bestowed on the
beauty of the Kerka, and the view of
the Falls of Roncislap is especially
distinguished. Sir Gardner praises it
in artistic language; and we may be
allowed to regret that he has not
added a sketch of this scene to the
views with which his book is embellished.
The waters of the Kerka
possess a petrifying quality that is
common in Dalmatia. Much of the rock
has been formed under the water, and
must present a singular appearance.</p>

<p>Near the Falls of Roncislap a depôt
for coal has been established, that, by
all accounts, would seem to be anything
but a good speculation. We
mention it merely for the sake of a
good story that hangs by it. It
seems that the Austrian Lloyds' Company
patronise this coal because it is
cheap. It is one reason, certainly,
for buying it; but, as the coal will not
burn, we may doubt their wisdom.
We do not wish to spoil the market
of the Company of Dernis, but we
agree with Sir Gardner, that there are
reasonable objections to the using of
food for the furnaces that will get up
no steam, and must be taken on board
in such quantities, as to lumber up
the decks. Besides this, hear how it
goes on when it does burn:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has also the effect of causing much
smoke, and the large flakes of soot that
fall from the chimney upon the awning
actually burn holes in it, till it looks like
a sail riddled with grape-shot; and I remember
one day seeing the awning on
fire from one of these showers of soot;
when the captain calmly ordered it to be
put out, as if it had been a common occurrence."</p></blockquote>

<p>"A Russian consul,"&mdash;this is the
story:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A Russian consul, who happened to
be on board, and who was not much accustomed
to the smoky doings of steamers,
seemed to be deeply impressed with the
inconvenience of the falling flakes of soot.
His voice had rarely been heard during
the voyage, and he appeared to shun
communication with his fellow-passengers;
when one afternoon, the awning
not being up, he burst forth with these
startling remarks, uttered with a broad
Slavonian accent,&mdash;'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que ces baateaux à
vapeur sont sales! Par suite de maaladie,
il y a dix ans que je ne me zuis paas lavré,
mais maintenant j'ai zenti le bezoin de me
lavver, et je me zuis lavvé!!</i>'"</p></blockquote>

<p>This must have been a Russian of
the old school.</p>

<p>Arrived at the convent of St Archangelo,
they had every reason to be
content with their hospitable reception.
The Archimandrite is praised
as being gentlemanlike, and of mien
as though educated in a European
capital. This is a very unusual characteristic
of any Greek ecclesiastic,
and what we could predicate of but
one or two out of the numbers that
we have seen. Greek priests of any
kind are bad enough, but those living
in convents seem generally to go on
the principle of the Russian consul
just mentioned, and might fitly be
invited to associate with him. All
honour, then, to Stefano Knezovich,
and may his example be abundantly
followed among his brethren!</p>

<p>There was not much in the Greek
convent to induce a long visit; so the
next morning Sir Gardner pushed on
to Kistagne, in his progress through
the country. Here he was again the
victim of letter-writing, but in a different
way. The sirdar of Kistagne
took offence at the tone of the letter
sent to him by the Archimandrite, ordering
horses for the next morning;
and the luckless traveller was consequently
left in the lurch. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the monk did his best to make up for
the deficiency. He lent him his own
horse, and had his baggage conveyed
by some peasants&mdash;an excellent arrangement,
saving that the porters
were <em>female</em> peasants. This is a sort
of thing that sadly shocks our sense
of decorum, but which many folks
besides the Dalmatians take as a
matter of course. Sir Gardner says
that the custom of assigning the heavy
burden to the women is prevalent
among the Montenegrini; it is so also
among the Albanians; and to a most
atrocious extent in the Peloponnesus.
In this particular case, they were well
off to get the job; it was to exchange
their task of carrying heavy loads of
water up the hill for that of shouldering
his light <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impedimenta</i>.</p>

<p>Arrived at Kistagne, he found the
sirdar, who had been so disobliging
at a distance, much improved on acquaintance,
and from him he received
all requisite assistance for the prosecution
of his journey to Knin; and by
him was guided in his visit to the
Roman arches, which point out the
site of the ancient city of Burnum.</p>

<p>Knin is still a place of considerable
strength, and has been once upon a
time still stronger. It is identified
with the ancient Arduba. The marshy
character of the ground in its immediate
neighbourhood renders it an unhealthy
place of abode; but this evil
is easily removable by a moderate attention
to drainage. Not very far
from Knin, but over the Turkish border,
on the other side of Mount
Gniath, is supposed to be situated the
gold mine that of old conferred on
Dalmatia the title of auriferous. The
mine is said to exist here; but so
much mystery is observed on its subject
by the Turks that nothing certain
can be affirmed of it. From Verlicca,
to Sign we pass as quickly as may be,
merely noticing that there is another
convent to be visited <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i>, and
that we have the opportunity of putting
up at the Han, as Sir Gardner
did. These people certainly have admitted
a great many Turkish words
into their vocabulary: we have <em>Sirdar</em>,
and <em>Han</em>, and <em>Arambasha</em>&mdash;to say
nothing of others. At last we come
to <em>Sign</em>; and, touching this place, we
must give an extract from the book.
An annual tilting festival has been
established here, in commemoration of
the brave defence maintained in 1715,
against the Pasha of Bosnia with
forty thousand men.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The privilege of tilting is confined to
natives of Sign, and its territory. Every
one is required to appear dressed in the
ancient costume, with the Tartar cap,
called kalpak, surmounted by a white
heron's plume, or with flowers interlaced
in it. He is to wear a sword, to carry a
lance, and to be mounted on a good horse
richly caparisoned."</p>

<p>"The opening of the <em>giostra</em> is in this
manner: The <em>footmen</em>, richly dressed and
armed, advance two by two before the cavaliers.
In the usual annual exhibitions
each cavalier has one <em>footman</em>; and on extraordinary
occasions, besides the footman,
he has a <em>padrino</em> well mounted and equipped.
After the <em>footmen</em> come three persons
in line&mdash;one carrying a shield, and the other
two by his side bearing a sort of ancient
club; then a fair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">manège</i> horse, led by
the hand, with large housings and complete
trappings, richly ornamented, followed
by two cavaliers&mdash;one the adjutant,
the other the ensign-bearer. Next comes
the <i>Maestro-di-Campo</i>, accompanied by
the two <em>jousters</em>, and followed by all the
others, marching two and two. The rear of
the procession is brought up by the <i>Chiauss</i>,
who rides alone, and whose duty it is to
maintain order during the ceremony."</p></blockquote>

<p>We have a description of a fair at
Sign that is almost as suggestive of
the picturesque as was the account of
similar doings at Salona. Sir Gardner
shall give his own account of his departure
from the town.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the midst of the bustle and business
going on at Sign, I found some difficulty
in getting horses to take me on to
Spalato; but a letter to the Sirdar removed
every impediment, and, after a
few hours' delay, the animals being
brought out, I prepared to start from the
not very splendid inn.' 'Can you ride
in that?' asked the ostler, pointing to a
huge Turkish saddle that nearly concealed
the whole animal, with stirrups that
might pass for a pair of coal scuttles;
and finding that I was accustomed to the
use as well as sight of that un-European
horse-furniture, he seemed well satisfied&mdash;observing,
at the same time, that it was
fortunate, as there was no other to be
had.... I was glad to take what
I could get, and my only question in return
was, whether the horse could trot;
which being settled, I posted off, leaving
my guide and baggage to come after me&mdash;for,
thanks to the Austrian police, there
is no fear of robbers appropriating a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
portmanteau in Dalmatia: the interesting
days of adventure and the Haiduk
banditti have passed, and the Morlacchi
have ceased to covet, or at least to take
other men's goods."</p></blockquote>

<p>And now we make a resolute halt,
and determine to pass <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub silentio</i> all
that intervenes between this part of
the book and the coming into the
country of the Montenegrini. Unless
we act thus discreetly, we shall never
contrive to compress all we have to
say into due limits; and even now we
hardly know how this desirable result
is to be effected. What we thus
leave as fallow-ground for the reader
will yield to his research a history of
the coast and islands between Spalato
and Cattaro. The notice of Ragusa
is especially and deservedly full, and
presents an admirable condensation of
Ragusan history.</p>

<p>But it is high time for us to get
amongst the children of the Black
Mountain. Among things excellent
it is permitted to institute comparison
without disparagement to any of
them: and, in virtue of this license,
we are free to say that this part of
Sir Gardner's book shines forth as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter minora sidera</i>. The subject itself
is of deep intrinsic interest; and he
has treated it as we well knew that
he would. A picture is given of the
actual condition of a scion of the
Christian stock that must astonish
those who, by this book, first learn to
think of the Montenegrini; and must
delight those who, having heard somewhat
of them, or haply even paid them
a flying visit, have looked in vain for
some accurate statement of detail to
help out their personal observations.</p>

<p>The Montenegrini are descended from
the old Servian stock, and still look to
modern Servia with affection, as to
their mother country. Thither also we
find them, by Sir Gardner's account,
retiring, when forced by poverty to
emigrate from their own territory.
Among them the Slavonian language
is preserved in unusual purity. The
present population is about 100,000;
and the number of fighting men
amounts to 20,000&mdash;a number which,
on occasion of need, would be greatly
augmented by the calling out of the
veterans. In fact every individual
man of the nation, whose arm has
power to wield a weapon, is a warrior;
and the very women are ready to assist
in defence. On the Turkish border,
as is well known, a constant
system of bloody reprisals is going
on; and the endeavours of the Vladika
to reduce their hostilities to
civilised fashion have hitherto failed
of success. They are sustained at
the highest pitch of confident daring
by the successful war which they
have so long been able to carry on
against their powerful neighbours.
One is glad of the opportunity of
giving, on the authority of Sir Gardner,
some of the stories of their prowess;
for to retail, without the authority
of some such <em>padrino</em>, the tales
current in Cattaro, would be to win the
reputation of talking like Mendez Pinto.</p>

<p>In judging the Montenegrini, we
should give charitable consideration
to their circumstances. War is a
system of violence; and with them,
unhappily, war is a permanent condition
of existence. The treachery
and cruelty of the Turks&mdash;are these
such recent developments that we need
make any doubt of them?&mdash;have
worked out cruel consequences in the
character of the Montenegrini. They
believe a Turk to be utterly without
honesty and good faith&mdash;one with
whom it is impossible to hold terms&mdash;and
such, probably, is about the right
estimate of some of their Turkish neighbours.
Who, for instance, that knows
anything about them, has any other
opinion of the Albanians? Are
Kaffirs much more hopeless subjects?
The Montenegrini are far from the
commission of the horrid cruelties
that are of everyday occurrence among
the Albanians. Their imperfect appreciation
of Christianity allows them
to behold in revenge a virtue; and
hence the acts of violence which are
quoted to their dispraise. Their marauding
expeditions are but according
to the usages of war; and if they
sometimes break through the restrictions
of a truce, it would seem to be
because they really do not understand
what a truce is. We think
that a very apt apology for the
Montenegrini is found in the speech of
a German traveller quoted by Sir
Gardner. He had been mentioning
several occurrences of English and
Scotch history, and spoke in allusion
to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'What think you,' he observed, 'of
the state of society in those times? Were
the border forays of the English and
Scotch more excusable than those of the
Montenegrins? And how much more
natural is the unforgiving hatred of the
Montenegrins against the Turks, the
enemies of their country, and their faith,
than the relentless strife of Highland
clans, with those of their own race and
religion! Has not many an old castle in
other parts of Europe, witnessed scenes
as bad as any enacted by this people?
I do not wish to exculpate the Montenegrins;
but theirs is still a dark age,
and some allowance must be made for
their uncivilised condition.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The character of the present Vladika
affords good hope that an improvement
will take place among the
people; for he evidently has devoted
all his energies to their amelioration.
Sir Gardner entered their territory,
by what we believe to be the only
route&mdash;that is to say from Cattaro&mdash;whence
he took letters of introduction
from the Austrian governor to
the Vladika.</p>

<p>We shall best illustrate the condition
of the Montenegrini by quoting
some of Sir Gardner's accounts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Four Montenegrins, and their sister,
aged twenty-one, going on a pilgrimage
to the shrine of St Basilio, were waylaid
by seven Turks, in a rocky defile, so
narrow that they could only thread it
one by one; and hardly had they entered
between the precipices that bordered it
on either side, when an unexpected discharge
of fire-arms killed one brother,
and desperately wounded another. To
retrace their steps was impossible without
meeting certain and shameful death,
since to turn their backs would give their
enemy the opportunity of destroying
them at pleasure.</p>

<p>"The two who were unhurt, therefore,
advanced and returned the fire, killing
two Turks&mdash;while the wounded one,
supporting himself against a rock, fired
also, and mortally injured two others,
but was killed himself in the act. His
sister, taking his gun, loaded and fired
simultaneously with her two brothers,
but, at the same instant, one of them
dropped down dead. The two surviving
Turks then rushed furiously at the only
remaining Montenegrin&mdash;who, however,
laid open the skull of one of them with
his yatagan, before receiving his own
death-blow. The hapless sister, who had
all this time kept up a constant fire,
stood for an instant irresolute; when
suddenly assuming an air of terror and
supplication, she entreated for mercy;
but the Turk, enraged at the death of
his companions, was brutal enough to
take advantage of the unhappy girl's
agony, and only promised her life at the
price of her honour. Hesitating at first,
she pretended to listen to the villain's
proposal; but no sooner did she see him
thrown off his guard, than she buried in
his body the knife she carried at her
girdle. Although mortally wounded, the
Turk endeavoured to make the most of
his failing strength, and plucking the
dagger from his side, staggered towards
the courageous girl,&mdash;who, driven to
despair, threw herself on the relentless
foe, and with superhuman energy hurled
him down the neighbouring precipice, at
the very moment when some shepherds,
attracted by the continued firing,
arrived just too late for the rescue."</p></blockquote>

<p>Fancy the tone that must be given
to their lives by the constant necessity
of being ready for encounters
such as this. They never lay aside
their arms; but in the field, or by the
wayside, are armed and alert. One
hand may be allowed to the implement
of tillage, but the other must be
reserved for the weapon of defence.</p>

<p>On many occasions, Montenegrin
courage has prevailed against odds
far greater than in the above case&mdash;indeed
such odds as, but for authentication
of facts, would be incredible.
In the year 1840, "seventy Montenegrins,
in the open field, withstood the
attack of several thousand Turks;
and having made breastworks with the
bodies of their fallen foes, maintained
the unequal conflict till night; when
forty who survived forced their way
through the hostile army, and escaped
with their lives." Another astonishing
achievement was the successful defence
of a house held by seven-and-twenty
Montenegrins, against a body of about
six thousand Albanians. Of this last
action, trophies are preserved by the
Vladika in his palace at Tzetinié, and
there Sir Gardner saw them.</p>

<p>We cannot wonder that the effect
on their minds of these astonishing
successes, should be an unbounded
confidence in their superiority over
the Turks. Sir Gardner Wilkinson
found them impressed with the idea,
that bread and arms were the only
needful requisites to enable them to
drive the Turks out of Albania and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Herzegovina. It seems certain that,
in their rencontres With these enemies,
they dismiss all ordinary considerations
of prudence. The spirit
of their feeling with regard to the
Turks is thus portrayed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not the courage, but the cruelty
of the Turks which inspires him (the
Montenegrin) with hatred; and the sufferings
inflicted upon his country by their
inroads makes him look upon them with
feelings of ferocious vengeance.</p>

<p>"These savage sentiments are kept
alive by the barbarous custom, adopted
by both parties, of cutting off the heads
of the wounded and the dead; the consequences
of which are destructive of all
the conditions of fair warfare, and preclude
the possibility of peace. The bitter
remembrance of the past is constantly
revived by the horrors of the present;
and the love of revenge, which strongly
marks the character of the Montenegrin,
makes him insensible to reason or justice,
and places the Turks, in his opinion, out
of the pale of human beings. He dreams
only of vengeance; he cares little for the
means employed, and the man who
should make any excuse for not persecuting
those enemies of his country and
his faith, would be treated with ignominy
and contempt. Even the sanctity of a
truce is not always sufficient to restrain
him; and the hatred of the Turk is paramount
to all ordinary considerations of
honour or humanity."</p></blockquote>

<p>This cutting off of heads is not
peculiar to the Montenegrins. The
Turks are, in this respect, just as bad,
and Sir Gardner found, on the occasion
of his visit to Mostar, that, in
point of this barbarism, there is not a
pin to choose between them. The
Turks, however, exceed in cruelty.
It appears, on the evidence of the
letter of the Vladika, given in the
second volume, that they (the Turks)
impale men alive; whereas the Montenegrins
are chargeable with no
wanton cruelty. Indeed, they do not
restrict the performance of this operation
to the case of enemies; but, as
an act of friendship, decapitate any
comrade who may so be wounded in
action as to have no other means of
avoiding capture by the enemy. "You
are very brave," said a well-meaning
Montenegrin to a portly Russian officer,
who was unable to keep up with
his detachment in its retreat,&mdash;"you
are very brave, <em>and must wish that I
should cut off your head</em>: say a prayer,
and make the sign of the cross."</p>

<p>Life, passed amidst every hardship,
and threatened by constant and deadly
peril, ought, we suppose, according to
all rule, to be short in duration. But
we find that these people are remarkable
for longevity. A family is mentioned,
in one of the villages, which
reckoned six generations, there and
then extant. The head of the family
was a great-great-great-grandfather.</p>

<p>The Vladika received his visitor
most courteously, as he always does
those who have the privilege of being
presented to him. He afforded to Sir
Gardner every facility for seeing the
country, and engaged his secretary to
draw up for him a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">précis</i> of Montenegrin
history. We will condense
some of its more important facts.
The supremacy in things spiritual and
temporal has not been very long
vested, as it at present is, in the person
of the Vladika. The two chieftain-ships
were of old distinct, and the
figment of a separate temporal authority
was continued till comparatively
lately: the year 1832 is mentioned
as the epoch at which the office of
civil chief was definitely suppressed.
The present family (Petrovich) have
possessed the dignity of the Vladikate
since the close of the seventeenth
century. The reigning Vladika&mdash;this
man of magnificent presentment&mdash;this
brave, intellectual, and athletic
ruler of an indomitable race&mdash;is
nephew of the late Vladika, who has
been canonised, although but few
years have passed since his death.
The prince-bishop is not theoretically
absolute in power, as the form of a
republic is kept up: the general
assembly has the right of deliberation,
under the presidency of the Vladika.
But this restriction of power is
pretty nearly nominal only: we give
Sir Gardner's account of the native
Diet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In a semicircular recess, formed by
the rocks on one side of the plain of
Tzetinié, and about half a mile to the
southward of the town, is a level piece of
grass land, with a thicket of low poplar
trees. Here the diet is held, from which
the spot has received the name of <i>mali
sbor</i> (the small assembly.) When any
matter is to be discussed, the people meet
in this their Runimede, or 'meadow of
council,' and partly on the level space,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
partly on the rocks, receive from the
Vladika notice of the question proposed.
The duration of the discussion is limited
to a certain time, at the expiration
of which the assembly is expected to
come to a decision; and when the
monastery bell orders silence, notwithstanding
the most animated discussion, it
is instantly restored. The Metropolitan
asks again what is their decision, and
whether they agree to his proposal or not.
The answer is always the same: '<i lang="cs" xml:lang="cs">Budi
po to oyema, Vladika</i>,'&mdash;'Let it be as
thou wishest, Vladika.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Montenegro first secured its independence
about a generation or two
before the time of the famous Scanderbeg,
on the breaking up of the
kingdom of Servia. Since that time
they have constantly been subject to
the inroads of the Turks, who, claiming
them as tributaries, have continued
to invade their country every now
and then with savage cruelty. More
than once they have carried fire and
sword to Tzetinié, but have never
been able to hold their ground. The
Montenegrins sought the protection of
Russia in the time of Peter the Great,
and still continue to be subsidised by
Russia. At the desire of Peter, they
invaded the Turkish territory, and
were subjected to reprisals on a grand
scale. At one time 60,000 Turks, at
another 120,000, broke into Montenegro.
The first invasion was
gloriously repulsed; but the second,
combining treachery with violence,
was successful. Great damage was
done to the country; but the invaders
were at last obliged to quit, on the
breaking out of war between Turkey
and Venice. The Montenegrins then
returned to their desolate homes, and
have since been unintermitting in
their diligence to pay off old scores.
They co-operated with the Austrians
and Russians, when they had the
opportunity of such assistance; and
when they stood alone, they did so
nobly and bravely. The last great
expedition of the Turks was in the
time of the late Vladika. The Pasha
of Scutari, with an enormous force,
invaded the country; and the result
of the expedition was that 30,000
Turks were killed, and among them
the Pasha of Albania, whose head
now serves as a trophy of victory to
decorate Tzetinié.</p>

<p>The capital of the Vladika, has
been described before&mdash;for instance, in
the pages of this Magazine; so, with
one brief extract concerning it, we
will follow Sir Gardner in his progress
through the country.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On a rock immediately above the
convent is a round tower pierced with
embrasures, but without cannon, on which
I counted the heads of twenty Turks
fixed upon stakes round the parapet&mdash;the
trophies of Montenegrin victory; and below,
scattered upon the rock, were the
fragments of other skulls, which had fallen
to pieces by time,&mdash;a strange spectacle in
a Christian country, in Europe, and in the
immediate vicinity of a convent and a
bishop's palace!"</p></blockquote>

<p>And, as we said before, when he
got to Mostar, in Herzegovina, he
found a spectacle of the same shocking
kind. He did allow his horror at
this sight to evaporate ineffectually;
but in earnest tried to interpose his
good offices to prevent a continuance
of these doings. He talked to the two
people mainly concerned&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> to the
Vizir of Herzegovina, and to the Vladika.
He also, at Constantinople,
endeavoured to effect the making of
an appeal to the highest Turkish authority.
His correspondence with the
Vladika on the subject is evidence of
his zeal; but no positive good seems
to have been the result of his intercession.</p>

<p>The road leading from the capital
to Ostrok is described as being very
bad at first, and bad beyond description
as it recedes from the capital.
The Vladika kindly sent with Sir
Gardner one of his guards and an interpreter.
The party passed by several
villages, and arrived at Mishke,
the principal village of the Cevo district,
where they put up for the night
at the house of the principal senator
of the province. Here some amusement
was afforded by Sir Gardner's
proceeding to sketch the domestic
party.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening a scene
occurred, which sets forth their social
condition as graphically as the artist's
pencil has their personal appearance.
A party of friends came in to have a
quiet pipe, and to plan a foray over
the border.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On inquiry, I found the expedition
was to take place immediately. "Is there
not," I asked, "a truce at this moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
between you and the Turks of Herzegovina?"
They laughed, and seemed
much amused at my scruples. "We
don't mind that," said a stern swarthy
man, taking his pipe from his mouth, and
shaking his head to and fro; "they are
Turks"&mdash;and all agreed that the Turks
were fair game. "Besides," they said,
"it is only to be a plundering excursion;"
and they evidently considered that any
one refusing to join in a marauding expedition
into Turkey, at any time, or in an
open attack during a war, would be unworthy
the name of a brave man. They
seemed to treat the matter like boys in "the
good old times," who robbed orchards;
the courage it showed being in proportion
to the risk, and scruples of conscience
were laughed at as a want of spirit."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a freshly-decapitated head, affixed
to a stake at Mostar, he shortly
afterwards recognised the features of
one of these very men.</p>

<p>On the next day he proceeded to
Ostrok, and found occasion to admire
the scenery by the way, especially the
vale of Oranido, distant from Mishke
about four hours. From the vale of
Oranido to Ostrok is a journey of
about the same time. At Ostrok he
underwent a grand reception, and
fully won the hearts of his new friends
by proposing a ride to the Turkish
frontier, and affording them by the
way an exhibition of Memlook riding.
On the frontier is constantly maintained
a guard of Montenegrins, to give
timely warning of any suspicious
movement among the Turks; and so
well do they execute this office that
no Turk can approach the border
without being shot at. Near this
border it was that, some little time
ago, in 1843, an affair took place
which does not tell well for the Montenegrini;
and which seems for the present
to preclude hope of amicable arrangement
with the Turks. A deputation
of twenty-two Turks, returning
from Ostrok, were attacked by the
people, and nine of them killed. This
breach of faith is, to their minds,
excused by the suspicion of meditated
treachery on the part of the Turks.
But it is a sad affair; and the only
circumstance which goes in mitigation
of its guilt is, that the Vladika
took precautions against its occurrence.
He sent an armed guard to
protect the deputation, but their defence
proved insufficient.</p>

<p>The Archimandrite of Ostrok is the
person who holds the place of second
dignity in the government. He ranks
next to the Vladika; and we are glad
to find, by Sir Gardner's account, that
he cordially co-operates with the Vladika
in his plans of amelioration. Here
also was met the celebrated priest and
warrior, Ivan Knezovich, or Popé Yovan&mdash;a
man who, in this nation of
brave men, is renowned as the bravest.
There are two convents at Ostrok, of
which one fulfils also the function of
powder magazine and store depot. Its
position is very remarkable; and certainly
it does bear a strong family
likeness to Megaspelion. The same
quality of not being within reach of
any missile from above belongs to both
of them, and has proved the saving of
both.</p>

<p>The return to Tzetinié was by a
different route, which took Sir Gardner
within near view of the northern
end of the lake of Scutari. The island
of Vranina, situated at this extremity
of the lake, is likely to afford the next
ostensible ground for an outbreak. It
belonged to Montenegro, but, a few
years ago, was treacherously seized
by the Albanians, who effected a surprise
in time of peace. Remonstrances
and hard blows have equally
failed to promote a restoration, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et adhuc
sub judice lis est</i>. Throughout the
course of his journey, Sir Gardner experienced
much and genuine kindness
from the rude people of the country;
they brought him presents of such
things as they had to offer, and would
accept no compensation. When at last
he bade them farewell, and returned
to the haunts of civilisation, it was
evidently with kindly recollections of
them, and with the best of good-will
towards them. He was able to give
a satisfactory account of his impressions
to the Vladika, who inquired
thus,&mdash;"What do you think of the
people? Do they appear to you the
assassins and barbarians some people
pretend to consider them? I hope you
found them all well-behaved and civil&mdash;they
are poor, but that does not
prevent their being hospitable and
generous."</p>

<p>The ancients, who lived beyond
the reach of the fangs and feelers of
the printing press, had, in one respect,
a decided advantage over us unlucky
moderns. They were not beset by
the terrors of biography. No hideous
suspicion that, after he was dead and
gone&mdash;after the wine had been poured
upon the hissing embers of the pyre,
and the ashes consigned, by the hands
of weeping friends, to the oblivion of
the funereal urn&mdash;some industrious
gossip of his acquaintance would incontinently
sit down to the task of
laborious compilation and collection
of his literary scraps, ever crossed,
like a sullen shadow, the imagination
of the Greek or the Latin poet. Homer,
though Arctinus was his near relative,
could unbosom himself without
the fear of having his frailties posthumously
exposed, or his amours
blazoned to the world. Lucius Varius
and Plotius Tucca, the literary executors
of Virgil, never dreamed of
applying to Pollio for the I O Us
which he doubtless held in the handwriting
of the Mantuan bard, or to
Horace for the confidential notes
suggestive of Falernian inspiration.
Socrates, indeed, has found a liberal
reporter in Plato; but this is a pardonable
exception. The son of Sophroniscus
did not write; and therefore
it was incumbent on his pupil to
preserve for posterity the fragments of
his oral wisdom. The ancient authors
rested their reputation upon their published
works alone. They knew, what
we seem to forget, that the poet,
apart from his genius, is but an ordinary
man, and, in many cases, has
received, along with that gift, a larger
share of propensities and weaknesses
than his fellow-mortals. Therefore
it was that they insisted upon that
right of domestic privacy which is
common to us all. The poet, in his
public capacity as an author, held
himself responsible for what he wrote;
but he had no idea of allowing the
whole world to walk into his house,
open his desk, read his love-letters,
and criticise the state of his finances.
Had Varius and Tucca acted on the
modern system, the ghost of Virgil
would have haunted them on their
death-beds. Only think what a legacy
might have been ours if these
respectable gentlemen had written to
Cremona for anecdotes of the poet
while at school! No doubt, in some
private nook of the old farm-house at
Andes, there were treasured up,
through the infinite love of the mother,
tablets scratched over with
verses, composed by young Master
Maro at the precocious age of ten.
We may, to a certainty, calculate&mdash;for
maternal fondness always has been
the same, and Virgil was an only
child&mdash;that, in that emporium, themes
upon such topics as "Virtus est sola
nobilitas" were religiously treasured,
along with other memorials of the
dear, dear boy who had gone to college
at Naples. Modern Varius would
remorselessly have printed these:
ancient Tucca was more discreet.
Then what say you to the college
career? Would it not be a nice thing
to have all the squibs and feuds, the
rows and rackettings of the jovial
student preserved to us precisely as
they were penned, projected, and
perpetrated? Have we not lost a great
deal in being defrauded of an account
of the manner in which he singed the
wig of his drunken old tutor, Parthenius
Nicenus, or the scandalously
late hours which he kept in company
with his especial chums? Then comes
the period, darkly hinted at by Donatus,
during which he was, somehow
or other, connected with the imperial
stable; that is, we presume, upon the
turf. What would we not give for
a sight of Virgil's betting-book! Did
he back the field, or did he take
the odds on the Emperor's bay
mare, Alma Venus Genetrix? How
stood he with the legs? What sort
of reputation did he maintain in
the ring of the Roman Tattersall?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Was he ever posted as a defaulter?
Tucca! you should have told us
this. Then, when sobered down, and
in high favour with the court, where
is the private correspondence between
him and Mæcenas, the President of
the Roman Agricultural Society,
touching the compilation of the
Georgics? The excellent Equestrian,
we know, wanted Virgil to construct
a poem, such as Thomas Tusser afterwards
wrote, under the title of a "<cite>Hondreth
Good Points of Husbandrie</cite>,"
and, doubtless, waxed warm in his
letters about draining, manure, and
mangel-wurzel. What sacrifice would
we not make to place that correspondence
in the hands of Henry Stephens!
How the author of the <cite>Book of the
Farm</cite> would revel in his exposure of
the crude theories of the Minister of
the Interior! What a formidable
phalanx of facts would he oppose to
Mæcenas' misconceptions of guano!
Through the sensitive delicacy of his
executors, we have lost the record of
Virgil's repeated larks with Horace:
the pleasant little supper-parties celebrated
at the villa of that dissipated
rogue Tibullus, have passed from the
memory of mankind. We know
nothing of the state of his finances,
for they have not thought fit to publish
his banking-account with the
firm of Lollius, Spuræna, and Company.
Their duty, as they fondly
believed, was fulfilled, when they gave
to the world the glorious but unfinished
Æneid.</p>

<p>Under the modern system, we constantly
ask ourselves whether it is
wise to wish for greatness, and
whether total oblivion is not preferable
to fame, with the penalty of
exposure annexed. We shudder at
the thoughts of putting out a book,
not from fear of anything that the
critics can do, but lest it should take
with the public, and expose us to the
danger of a posthumous biography.
Were we to awake some fine morning,
and find ourselves famous, our
peace of mind would be gone for ever.
Mercy on us! what a quantity of
foolish letters have we not written
during the days of our youth, under the
confident impression that, when read,
they would be immediately committed
to the flames. Madrigals innumerable
recur to our memory; and, if these
were published, there would be no rest
for us in the grave! If any misguided
critic should say of us, "The works
of this author are destined to descend
to posterity," our response would be
a hollow groan. If convinced that
our biography would be attempted,
from that hour the friend of our bosom
would appear in the light of a base
and ignominious spy. How durst we
ever unbosom ourselves to him, when,
for aught we know, the wretch may
be treasuring up our casual remarks
over the fifth tumbler, for immediate
registration at home? Constitutionally
we are not hard-hearted; but,
were we so situated, we own that the
intimation of the decease of each early
acquaintance would be rather a relief
than otherwise. Tom, our intimate
fellow-student at college, dies. We
may be sorry for the family of Thomas,
but we soon wipe away the natural
drops, discovering that there is balm
in Gilead. We used to write him
letters, detailing minutely our inward
emotions at the time we were distractedly
in love with Jemima Higginbotham;
and Tom, who was always
a methodical dog, has no doubt docqueted
them as received. Tom's heirs
will doubtless be too keen upon the
scent of valuables, to care one farthing
for rhapsodising: therefore, unless
they are sent to the snuff-merchant,
or disseminated as autographs, our
epistles run a fair chance of perishing
by the flames, and one evidence of
our weakness is removed. A member
of the club meets us in George Street,
and, with a rueful longitude of countenance,
asks us if we have heard of
the death of poor Harry? To the
eternal disgrace of human nature, be
it recorded, that our heart leaps up
within us like a foot-ball, as we hypocritically
have recourse to our cambric.
Harry knew a great deal too
much about our private history just
before we joined the Yeomanry, and
could have told some stories, little
flattering to our posthumous renown.</p>

<p>Are we not right, then, in holding
that, under the present system, celebrity
is a thing to be eschewed?
Why is it that we are so chary of
receiving certain Down-Easters, so
different from the real American
gentlemen whom it is our good fortune
to know? Simply because Silas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Fixings will take down your whole
conversation in black and white, deliberately
alter it to suit his private
purposes, and Transatlantically retail
it as a specimen of your life and
opinions. And is it not a still more
horrible idea that a Silas may be perpetually
watching you in the shape
of a pretended friend? If the man
would at once declare his intention,
you might be comparatively at ease.
Even in that case you never could
love him more, for the confession implies
a disgusting determination of
outliving you, or rather a hint that
your health is not remarkably robust,
which would irritate the meekest of
mankind. But you might be enabled,
through a strong effort, to repress
the outward exhibition of your wrath;
and, if high religious principle should
deter you from mixing strychnia or
prussic acid with the wine of your
volunteering executor, you may at
least contrive to blind him by cautiously
maintaining your guard.
Were we placed in such a trying
position, we should utter, before our
intending Boswell, nothing save sentiments
which might have flowed from
the lips of the Venerable Bede. What
letters, full of morality and high feeling,
would we not indite! Not an invitation
to dinner&mdash;not an acceptance of
a tea and turn-out, but should be
flavoured with some wholesome apothegm.
Thus we should strive,
through our later correspondence, to
efface the memory of the earlier,
which it is impossible to recall,&mdash;not
without a hope that we might throw
upon it, if posthumously produced, a
tolerable imputation of forgery.</p>

<p>In these times, we repeat, no man
of the least mark or likelihood is safe.
The waiter with the bandy-legs, who
hands round the negus-tray at a
blue-stocking coterie, is in all probability
a leading contributor to a fifth-rate
periodical; and, in a few days
after you have been rash enough
to accept the insidious beverage,
M'Tavish will be correcting the proof
of an article in which your appearance
and conversation are described.
Distrust the gentleman in the plush
terminations; he, too, is a penny-a-liner,
and keeps a commonplace-book
in the pantry. Better give up writing
at once than live in such a perpetual
state of bondage. What
amount of present fame can recompense
you for being shown up as a
noodle, or worse, to your children's
children? Nay, recollect this, that
you are implicating your personal,
and, perhaps, most innocent friends.
Bob accompanies you home from an
insurance society dinner, where the
champagne has been rather superabundant,
and, next morning, you, as
a bit of fun, write to the President
that the watchman had picked up
Bob in a state of helpless inebriety
from the kennel. The President, after
the manner of the Fogies, duly docquets
your note with name and date, and
puts it up with a parcel of others,
secured by red tape. You die. Your
literary executor writes to the President,
stating his biographical intentions,
and requesting all documents
that may tend to throw light upon
your personal history. Preses, in
deep ecstasy at the idea of seeing his
name in print as the recipient of your
epistolary favours, immediately transmits
the packet; and the consequence
is, that Robert is most unjustly
handed down to posterity in the
character of a habitual drunkard,
although it is a fact that a more
abstinent creature never went home
to his wife at ten. If you are an
author, and your spouse is ailing,
don't give the details to your intimate
friend, if you would not wish to publish
them to the world. Drop all
correspondence, if you are wise, and
have any ambition to stand well in
the eyes of the coming generation.
Let your conversation be as curt as
a Quaker's, and select no one for a
friend, unless you have the meanest
possible opinion of his capacity.
Even in that case you are hardly
secure. Perhaps the best mode of
combining philanthropy, society, and
safety, is to have nobody in the
house, save an old woman who is so
utterly deaf that you must order
your dinner by pantomime.</p>

<p>One mode of escape suggests itself,
and we do not hesitate to recommend it.
Let every man who underlies the terror
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peine forte et dure</i>, compile his
own autobiography at the ripe age of
forty-five. Few people, in this country,
begin to establish a permanent
reputation before thirty; and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
allow them fifteen years to complete
it. Now, supposing your existence
should be protracted to seventy, here
are clear five-and-twenty years remaining,
which may be profitably employed
in autobiography, by which
means you secure three vast advantages.
In the first place, you can
deal with your own earlier history
as you please, and provide against
the subsequent production of inconvenient
documents. In the second place,
you defeat the intentions of your excellent
friend and gossip, who will
hardly venture to start his volumes in
competition with your own. In the third
place, you leave an additional copyright
as a legacy to your children, and
are not haunted in your last moments
by the agonising thought that a stranger
in name and blood is preparing to
make money by your decease. It is,
of course, unnecessary to say one word
regarding the general tone of your
memoirs. If you cannot contrive to
block out such a fancy portrait of
your intellectual self as shall throw all
others into the shade, you may walk
on fearlessly through life, for your biography
never will be attempted.
Goethe, the most accomplished literary
fox of our age, perfectly understood
the value of these maxims, and forestalled
his friends, by telling his own
story in time. The consequence is,
that his memory has escaped unharmed.
Little Eckermann, his amanuensis
in extreme old age, did indeed
contrive to deliver himself of a small
Boswellian volume; but this publication,
bearing reference merely to the
dicta of Goethe at a safe period of
life, could not injure the departed poet.
The repetition of the early history,
and the publication of the early documents,
are the points to be especially
guarded.</p>

<p>We beg that these remarks may be
considered, not as strictures upon any
individual example, but as bearing
upon the general style of modern biography.
This is a gossiping world,
in which great men are the exceptions;
and when one of these ceases
to exist, the public becomes clamorous
to learn the whole minutiæ of his private
life. That is a depraved taste, and
one which ought not to be gratified.
The author is to be judged by the works
which he voluntarily surrenders to the
public, not by the tenor of his private
history, which ought not to be irreverently
exposed. Thus, in compiling
the life of a poet, we maintain that a
literary executor has purely a literary
function to perform. Out of the mass
of materials which he may fortuitously
collect, his duty is to select such portions
as may illustrate the public
doings of the man: he may, without
transgressing the boundaries of propriety,
inform us of the circumstances
which suggested the idea of any particular
work, the difficulties which
were overcome by the author in the
course of its composition, and even
exhibit the correspondence relative
thereto. These are matters of literary
history which we may ask for,
and obtain, without any breach of the
conventional rules of society. Whatever
refers to public life is public, and
may be printed: whatever refers solely
to domestic existence is private, and
ought to be held sacred. A very
little reflection, we think, will demonstrate
the propriety of this distinction.
If we have a dear and valued friend,
to whom, in the hours of adversity or
of joy, we are wont to communicate
the thoughts which lie at the bottom
of our soul, we write to him in the
full conviction that he will regard these
letters as addressed to himself alone.
We do not insult him, nor wrong the
holy attributes of friendship so much,
as to warn him against communicating
our thoughts to any one else in
the world. We never dream that he
will do so, else assuredly those letters
never would have been written. If
we were to discover that we had so
grievously erred as to repose confidence
in a person who, the moment
he received a letter penned in a paroxysm
of emotion and revealing a
secret of our existence, was capable
of exhibiting it to the circle of his
acquaintance, of a surety he should
never more be troubled with any of
our correspondence. Would any man
dare to print such documents during
the life of the writer? We need not
pause for a reply: there can be but
one. And <em>why</em> is this? Because
these communications bear on their
face the stamp of the strictest privacy&mdash;because
they were addressed to,
and meant for the eye of but one
human being in the universe&mdash;because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
they betray the emotions of a soul
which asks sympathy from a friend,
with only less reverence than it implores
comfort from its God! Does
death, then, free the friend and the
confidant from all restraint? If the
knowledge that his secret had been
divulged, his agonies exposed, his
weaknesses surrendered to the vulgar
gaze, could have pained the living
man&mdash;is nothing due to his memory,
now that he is laid beneath the turf,
now that his voice can never more be
raised to upbraid a violated confidence?
Many modern biographers,
we regret to say, do not appear to be
influenced by any such consideration.
They never seem to have asked themselves
the question&mdash;Would my friend,
if he had been compiling his own memoirs,
have inserted such a letter for
publication&mdash;does it not refer to a
matter eminently private and personal,
and never to be communicated to the
world? Instead of applying this test,
they print everything, and rather
plume themselves on their impartiality
in suppressing nothing. They thus
exhibit the life not only of the author
but of the man. Literary and personal
history are blended together.
The senator is not only exhibited in
the House of Commons, but we are
courteously invited to attend at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accouchement</i> of his wife.</p>

<p>What title has any of us, in the
abstract, to write the private history
of his next-door neighbour? Be he
poet, lawyer, physician, or divine, his
private sayings and doings are his property,
not that of a gaping and curious
public. No man dares to say to another,
"Come, my good fellow! it is full
time that the world should know a
little about your domestic concerns.
I have been keeping a sort of note-book
of your proceedings ever since
we were at school together, and I intend
to make a few pounds by exhibiting
you in your true colours.
You recollect when you were in love
with old Tomnoddy's daughter? I
have written a capital account of your
interview with her that fine forenoon
in the Botanical Gardens! True,
she jilted you, and went off with
young Heavystern of the Dragoons,
but the public won't relish the scene a
bit the less on that account. Then I
have got some letters of yours from
our mutual friend Fitzjaw. How very
hard-up you must have been at the
time when you supplicated him for
twenty pounds to keep you out of jail!
You were rather severe, the other day
when I met you at dinner, upon your
professional brother Jenkinson; but I
daresay that what you said was all
very true, so I shall publish that likewise.
By the way&mdash;how is your
wife? She had a lot of money, had
she not? At all events people say
so, and it is shrewdly surmised that
you did not marry her for her beauty.
I don't mean to say that <em>I</em> think so,
but such is the <em>on dit</em>, and I have set
it down accordingly in my journal.
Do, pray, tell me about that quarrel
between you and your mother-in-law!
Is it true that she threw a
joint-stool at your head? How our
friends will roar when they see
the details in print!" Is the case
less flagrant if the manuscript is
not sent to press, until our neighbour
is deposited in his coffin? We cannot
perceive the difference. If the
feelings of living people are to be
taken as the criterion, only one of the
domestic actors is removed from the
stage of existence. Old Tomnoddy
still lives, and may not be abundantly
gratified at the fact of his daughter's
infidelity and elopement being proclaimed.
The intimation of the
garden scene, hitherto unknown to
Heavystern, may fill his warlike
bosom with jealousy, and ultimately
occasion a separation. Fitzjaw can
hardly complain, but he will be very
furious at finding his refusal to accommodate
a friend appended to the supplicating
letter. Jenkinson is only
sorry that the libeller is dead, otherwise
he would have treated him to an
action in the Jury Court. The widow
believes that she was made a bride
solely for the sake of her Californian
attractions, and reviles the memory
of her spouse. As for the mother-in-law,
now gradually dwindling into
dotage, her feelings are perhaps of no
great consequence to any human
being. Nevertheless, when the obnoxious
paragraph in the Memoirs is
read to her by a shrill female companion,
nature makes a temporary
rally, her withered frame shakes with
agitation, and she finally falls backward
in a fit of hopeless paralysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is a feeble picture of the results
that might ensue from private
biography, were we all permitted,
without reservation, to parade the
lives and domestic circumstances of
our neighbours to a greedy and gloating
world. Not but that, if our
neighbour has been a man of sufficient
distinction to deserve commemoration,
we may gracefully and skilfully narrate
all of him that is worth the knowing.
We may point to his public actions,
expatiate on his achievements,
and recount the manner in which he
gained his intellectual renown; but further
we ought not to go. The confidences
of the dead should be as sacred
as those of the living. And here we
may observe, that there are other
parties quite as much to blame as the
biographers in question. We allude
to the friends of the deceased, who
have unscrupulously furnished them
with materials. Is it not the fact
that in very many cases they have
divulged letters which, during the
writer's lifetime, they would have
withheld from the nearest and dearest
of their kindred? In many such
letters there occur observations and
reflections upon living characters, not
written in malice, but still such as
were never intended to meet the eyes
of the parties criticised; and these
are forthwith published, as racy passages,
likely to gratify the appetite of
a coarse, vulgar, and inordinate curiosity.
Even this is not the worst.
Survivors may grieve to learn that
the friend whom they loved was capable
of ridiculing or misrepresenting
them in secret, and his memory may
suffer in their estimation; but, put
the case of detailed private conversations,
which are constantly foisted
into modern biographies, and we shall
immediately discover that the inevitable
tendency is to engender dislikes
among living parties. Let us suppose
that three men, all of them professional
authors, meet at a dinner
party. The conversation is very lively,
takes a literary turn, and the three
gentlemen, with that sportive freedom
which is very common in a society
where no treachery is apprehended,
pass some rather poignant strictures
upon the writings or habits of their
contemporaries. One of them either
keeps a journal, or is in the habit of
writing, for the amusement of a confidential
friend at a distance, any
literary gossip which may be current,
and he commits to paper the heads of
the recent dialogue. He dies, and his
literary executor immediately pounces
upon the document, and, to the confusion
of the two living critics, prints it.
Every literary brother whom they have
noticed is of course their enemy for life.</p>

<p>If, in private society, a snob is discovered
retailing conversations, he is
forthwith cut without compunction.
He reads his detection in the calm,
cold scorn of your eye; and, referring
to the mirror of his own dim and dirty
conscience, beholds the reflection of a
hound. The biographer seems to consider
himself exempt from such social
secresy. He shelters himself under
the plea that the public are so deeply
interested, that they must not be deprived
of any memorandum, anecdote,
or jotting, told, written, or detailed
by the gifted subject of their memoirs.
Therefore it is not a prudent thing to
be familiar with a man of genius. He
may not betray your confidence, but
you can hardly trust to the tender
mercies of his chronicler.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are our deliberate views upon
the subject of biography, and we
state them altogether independent of
the three bulky volumes which are
now lying before us for review.</p>

<p>We cordially admit that it was right
and proper that a life of Campbell
should be written. Although he did
not occupy the same commanding
position as others of his renowned
contemporaries&mdash;although his writings
have not, like those of Scott,
Byron, and Southey, contributed
powerfully to give a tone and idiosyncrasy
to the general literature of
the age&mdash;Campbell was nevertheless
a man of rich genius, and a poet of
remarkable accomplishment. It would
not be easy to select, from the works
of any other writer of our time, so
many brilliant and polished gems,
without flaw or imperfection, as are
to be found amongst his minor poems.
Criticism, in dealing with these exquisite
lyrics, is at fault. If sometimes
the suspicion of a certain effeminacy
haunts us, we have but to turn
the page, and we arrive at some magnificent,
bold, and trumpet-toned ditty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
appealing directly from the heart of
the poet to the imagination of his
audience, and proving, beyond all
contest, that power was his glorious
attribute. True, he was unequal;
and towards the latter part of his career,
exhibited a marked failing in the
qualities which originally secured his
renown. It is almost impossible to
believe that the <cite>Pilgrim of Glencoe</cite>,
or even <cite>Theodric</cite>, was composed by
the author of the <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>
or <cite>Gertrude</cite>; and if you place the
<cite>Ritter Bann</cite> beside <cite>Hohenlinden</cite> or the
<cite>Battle of the Baltic</cite>, you cannot fail to
be struck with the singular diminution
of power. Campbell started
from a high point&mdash;walked for some
time along level or undulating ground&mdash;and
then began rapidly to descend.
This is not, as some idle critics have
maintained, the common course of
genius. Chaucer, Spenser, Shakspeare,
Milton, Dryden, Scott, Byron,
and Wordsworth, are remarkable instances
to the contrary. Whatever
may have been the promise of their
youth, their matured performances,
eclipsing their earlier efforts, show
us that genius is capable of almost
boundless cultivation, and that the
fire of the poet does not cease to
burn less brightly within him, because
the sable of his hair is streaked
with gray, or the furrows deepening
on his brow. Sir Walter Scott was
upwards of thirty before he began to
compose in earnest: after thirty,
Campbell wrote scarcely anything
which has added permanently to his
reputation. Extreme sensitiveness,
an over-strained and fastidious desire
of polishing, and sometimes
the pressure of outward circumstances,
may have combined to damp
his early ardour. He evidently was
deficient in that resolute pertinacity
of labour, through which alone
great results can be achieved. He
allowed the best years of his life to be
frittered away, in pursuits which
could not secure to him either additional
fame, or the more substantial
rewards of fortune: and, though far
from being actually idle, he was only
indolently active. Campbell wanted
an object in life. Thus, though gifted
with powers which, directed towards
one point, were capable of the highest
concentration, we find him scattering
these in the most desultory and careless
manner; and surrendering scheme
after scheme, without making the
vigorous effort which was necessary
to secure their completion. This is a
fault by no means uncommon in literature,
but one which is highly dangerous.
No work requiring great
mental exertion should be undertaken
rashly, for the enthusiasm which has
prompted it rapidly subsides, the
labour becomes distasteful to the writer,
and unless he can bend himself
to his task with the most dogged
perseverance, and a determination to
vanquish all obstacles, the result will
be a fragment or a failure. Of this we
find two notable instances recorded
in the book before us. Twice in his
life had Campbell meditated the construction
of a great poem, and twice
did he relinquish the task. Of the
<cite>Queen of the North</cite> but a few lines
remain: of his favourite projected
epic on the subject of Wallace,
nothing. Elegant trifles, sportive
verses, and playful epigrams were,
for many years, the last fruits of that
genius which had dictated the <cite>Pleasures
of Hope</cite>, and rejoiced the mariners
of England with a ballad worthy
of the theme. And yet, so powerful
is early association&mdash;so universal was
the recognition of the transcendant
genius of the boy, that when Campbell
sank into the grave, there was
lamentation as though a great poet
had been stricken down in his prime,
and all men felt that a brilliant light
had gone out among the luminaries
of the age. Therefore it was seemly
that his memory should receive that
homage which has been rendered to
others less deserving of it, and that
his public career, at least, should be
traced and given to the world.</p>

<p>It was Campbell's own wish that
Dr Beattie should undertake his biography.
Few perhaps knew the motives
which led to this selection; for
the assiduity, care, and filial attachment,
bestowed for years by the
warm-hearted physician upon the
poet, was as unostentatious as it was
honourable and devoted. Not from
the pages of this biography can the
reader form an adequate idea of the
extent and value of such disinterested
friendship: indeed it is not too much
to say, that the rare and exemplary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
kindness of Dr Beattie was the chief
consolation of Campbell during the
later period of his existence. It
was therefore natural that the dying
poet should have confided this trust
to one of whose affection he was
assured by so many rare and signal
proofs; and it is with a kindly feeling
to the author that we now approach
the consideration of the literary merits
of the book.</p>

<p>The admiration of Dr Beattie for
the genius of Campbell has in some
respects led him astray. It is easy to
see at a glance that his measure of
admiration is not of an ordinary kind,
but so excessive as to lead him beyond
all limit. He seems to have
regarded Campbell not merely as a
great poet, but as the great poet of the
age; and he is unwilling, æsthetically,
to admit any material diminution of
his powers. He still clings with a
certain faith to <em>Theodric</em>; and declines
to perceive any palpable failure even
in the <cite>Pilgrim of Glencoe</cite>. Verses
and fragments which, to the casual
reader, convey anything but the impression
of excellence, are liberally
distributed throughout the pages of the
third volume, and commented on with
evident rapture. He seems to think
that, in the case of his author, it may
be said, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil tetigit quod non
ornavit</i>;" and accordingly he is slow
to suppress, even where suppression
would have been of positive advantage.
In short, he is too full of his
subject to do it justice. In the hands
of a skilful and less biassed artisan,
the materials which occupy these
three volumes, extending to nearly
fourteen hundred pages of print, might
have been condensed into one highly
interesting and popular volume. We
should not then, it is true, have been
favoured with specimens of Campbell's
college exercises, with the
voluminous chronicles of his family,
with verses written at the age of eleven,
or with correspondence purely
domestic; but we firmly believe
that the reading public would have
been grateful to Dr Beattie, had he
omitted a great deal of matter connected
with the poet's earlier career,
which is of no interest whatever. The
Campbells of Kirnan were, we doubt
not, a highly respectable sept, and performed
their duty as kirk-elders for
many generations blamelessly in the
parish of Glassary. But it was not
necessary on that account to trace
their descent from the Black Knight Of
Lochawe, or to give the particular
history of the family for more than a
century and a half. Gillespic-le-Camile
may have been a fine fellow in
his day; but we utterly deny, in the
teeth of all the Campbells and Kembles
in the world, that he had a drop
of Norman blood in his veins. It is
curious to find the poet, at a subsequent
period, engaged in a correspondence,
as to the common ancestor of
these names, with one of the Kembles,
who, as Mrs Butler somewhere triumphantly
avers, were descended from
the lords of Campo-bello. Where
that favoured region may be, we know
not; but this we know, that in Gaelic
<i lang="gv" xml:lang="gv">Cambeul</i> signifies <em>wry-mouth</em>, and
hence, as is the custom with primitive
nations, the origin of the name. And
let not the sons of Diarmid be offended
at this, or esteem their glories
less, since the gallant Camerons owe
their name to a similar conformation
of the nose, and the Douglases to
their dark complexion. Having put
this little matter of family etymology
right, let us return to Dr Beattie.</p>

<p>The first volume, we maintain, is
terribly overloaded by trivial details,
and specimens of the kind to which
we have alluded. We need not enter
into these, except in so far as to state
that Thomas Campbell was the youngest
child of most respectable parents:
that his father, having been unfortunate
in business, was so reduced in
circumstances, that, whilst attending
Glasgow College, the young student
was compelled to have recourse to
teaching; that he acquitted himself
admirably, and to the satisfaction of
all his professors in the literary
classes; and that, for one vacation at
least, he resided as private tutor to a
family in the island of Mull. He
was then about eighteen, and had
already exhibited symptoms of a rare
poetical talent, particularly in translations
from the Greek. Dr Beattie's
zeal as a biographer may be gathered
from the following statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I applied last year to the Rev.
Dr M'Arthur, of Kilninian in Mull,
requesting him to favour me with such
traditional particulars regarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
poet as might still be current among
the old inhabitants; but I regret to
say that nothing of interest has resulted.
'In the course of my inquiries,'
he says, 'I have met with
only two individuals who had seen
Mr Campbell while he was in Mull,
and the amount of their information
is merely that he was <em>a very pretty
young man</em>. Those who must have
been personally acquainted with him
in this country, have, like himself,
descended into the tomb; so that no
authentic anecdotes of him can now
be procured in this quarter.'"</p>

<p>There is a simplicity in this which
has amused us greatly. Campbell, in
those days, was conspicuous for nothing&mdash;at
least, for no accomplishment
which could be appreciated in
that distant island. In all probability
two-thirds of the inhabitants of the
parish were Campbells, who expired
in utter ignorance of the art of writing
their names; so that to ask for literary
anecdotes, at the distance of half a
century, was rather a work of supererogation.</p>

<p>For two years more, Campbell led
a life of great uncertainty. He was
naturally averse to the drudgery of
teaching&mdash;an employment which never
can be congenial to a poetical and
creative nature. He had no decided
predilection for any of the learned professions;
for though he alternately
betook himself to the study of law,
physic, and divinity, it was hardly
with a serious purpose. He visited
Edinburgh in search of literary employment,
was for some time a clerk
in a writer's office, and, through the
kindness of the late Dr Anderson,
editor of a collection of the British
poets,&mdash;a man who was ever eager to
acknowledge and encourage genius,&mdash;he
received his first introduction to a
bookselling firm. From them he received
some little employment, but
not of a nature suited to his taste;
and we soon afterwards find him in
Glasgow, meditating the establishment
of a magazine&mdash;a scheme which
proved utterly abortive.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, he had
not been idle. At the age of twenty
the poetical instinct is active, and,
even though no audience can be found,
the muse will force its way. Campbell
had already translated two plays
of Æschylus and Euripides&mdash;an exercise
which no doubt developed largely
his powers of versification&mdash;and, further,
had begun to compose original
lyric verses. In the foreign edition of
his works, there is inserted a poem
called the Dirge of Wallace, written
about this period, which, with a very
little concentration, might have been
rendered as perfect as any of his later
compositions. In spirit and energy it
is assuredly inferior to none of them.
"But," says Dr Beattie, "the fastidious
author, who thought it too
rhapsodical, never bestowed a careful
revision upon it, and persisted in excluding
it from all the London editions."
We hope to see it restored
to its proper place in the next: in
the mean time we select the following
noble stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They lighted the tapers at dead of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And chaunted their holiest hymn:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But her brow and her bosom were damp with affright,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">And the Lady of Ellerslie wept for her lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When a death-watch beat in her lonely room,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When her curtain had shook of its own accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the raven had flapped at her window board,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To tell of her warrior's doom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Now sing ye the death-song, and loudly pray<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For the soul of my knight so dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And call me a widow this wretched day,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Since the warning of <span class="smcap">God</span> is here.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For a nightmare rests on my strangled sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The lord of my bosom is doomed to die!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His valorous heart they have wounded deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the blood-red tears shall his country weep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Yet knew not his country, that ominous hour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Ere the loud matin-bell was rung&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That the trumpet of death, from an English tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Had the dirge of her champion sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When his dungeon-light looked dim and red<br /></span>
<span class="i3">On the highborn blood of a martyr slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No anthem was sung at his lowly death-bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No weeping was there when <em>his</em> bosom bled,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And is heart was rent in twain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! it was not thus when his ashen spear<br /></span>

<span class="i1"><em>For his lance was not shivered on helmet or shield,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i1"><em>And the sword that was fit for archangel to wield</em><br /></span>
<span class="i3"><em>Was light in his terrible hand!</em><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Nothing can be finer than the lines
we have quoted in Italics, nor perhaps
did Campbell himself ever match
them. Local reputations are dearly
cherished in the west of Scotland, and
even at this early period our poet was
denominated "the Pope of Glasgow."</p>

<p>Again Campbell migrated to Edinburgh,
but still with no fixed determination
as to the choice of a profession:
his intention was to attend the
public lectures at the University, and
also to push his connexion with the
booksellers, so as to obtain the means
of livelihood. Failing this last resource,
he contemplated removing to America,
in which country his eldest brother
was permanently settled. Fortunately
for himself, he now made the
acquaintance of several young men
who were destined afterwards to
attract the public observation, and to
win great names in different branches
of literature. Among these were
Scott, Brougham, Leyden, Jeffrey,
Dr Thomas Brown, and Grahame, the
author of <cite>The Sabbath</cite>. Mr John
Richardson, who had the good fortune
to remain through life the intimate
friend both of Scott and Campbell,
was also, at this early period, the
chosen companion of the latter, and
contributed much, by his judicious
counsels and criticisms, to nerve the
poet for that successful effort which,
shortly afterwards, took the world of
letters by storm. Dr Anderson also
continued his literary superintendence,
and anxiously watched over the progress
of the new poem upon which
Campbell was now engaged. At
length, in 1799, the <cite>Pleasures of
Hope</cite> appeared.</p>

<p>Rarely has any volume of poetry
met with such rapid success. Campbell
had few living rivals of established
reputation to contend with; and the
freshness of his thought, the extreme
sweetness of his numbers, and the
fine taste which pervaded the whole
composition, fell like magic on the ear
of the public, and won their immediate
approbation. It is true that, as a
speculation, this volume did not prove
remarkably lucrative to the author:
he had disposed of the copyright
before publication for a sum of sixty
pounds, but, through the liberality of
the publishers, he received for some
years a further sum on the issue of
each edition. The book was certainly
worth a great deal more; but many
an author would be glad to surrender
all claim for profit on his first adventure,
could he be assured of such
valuable popularity as Campbell now
acquired. He presently became a
lion in Edinburgh society; and, what
was far better, he secured the countenance
and friendship of such men as
Dugald Stewart, Henry Mackenzie,
Dr Gregory, the Rev. Archibald Alison,
and Telford, the celebrated engineer.
It is pleasant to know that
the friendships so formed were interrupted
only by death.</p>

<p>Campbell had now, to use a common
but familiar phrase, the ball at
his foot, but never did there live a
man less capable of appreciating opportunity.
At an age when most
young men are students, he had won
fame&mdash;fame, too, in such measure and
of such a kind as secured him
against reaction, or the possibility of
a speedy neglect following upon so
rapid a success. Had he deliberately
followed up his advantage with anything
like ordinary diligence, fortune
as well as fame would have been his
immediate reward. Like Aladdin, he
was in possession of a talisman which
could open to him the cavern in which
a still greater treasure was contained;
but he shrunk from the labour which
was indispensable for the effort. He
either could not or would not summon
up sufficient resolution to betake himself
to a new task; but, under the
pretext of improving his mind by
travel, gave way to his erratic propensities,
and departed for the Continent
with a slender purse, and, as
usual, no fixity of purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>We confess that the portion of his
correspondence which relates to this
expedition does not appear to us remarkably
interesting. He resided
chiefly at Ratisbon, where his time
appears to have been tolerably equally
divided between writing lyrics for the
<cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, then under the
superintendence of Mr Perry, and
squabbling with the monks of the
Scottish Convent of Saint James.
Some of his best minor poems were
composed at this period; but it will
be easily comprehended that, from the
style of their publication in a fugitive
form, they could add but little at the
time to his reputation, and certainly
they did not materially improve his
finances. With a contemplated poem
of some magnitude&mdash;the <cite>Queen of the
North</cite>&mdash;he made little progress; and,
upon the whole, this year was spent
uncomfortably. After his return to
Britain, he resided for some time in
Edinburgh and London, mixing in the
best and most cultivated society, but
sorely straitened in circumstances,
which, nevertheless, he had not the
courage or the patience to improve.</p>

<p>A quarto edition of the <cite>Pleasures</cite>,
printed by subscription for his own
benefit, at length put him in funds,
and probably tempted him to marry.
Then came the real cares of life,&mdash;an
increased establishment, an increasing
family: new mouths to provide for,
and no settled mode of livelihood.
Of all literary men, Campbell was
least calculated, both by habit and
inclination, to pursue a profession
which, with many temptations, was
then, and is still, precarious. He was
not, like Scott, a man of business habits
and unflagging industry. His impulses
to write were short, and his
fastidiousness interfered with his impulse.
Booksellers were slow in offering
him employment, for they could
not depend on his punctuality. Those
who have frequent dealings with the
trade know how much depends upon
the observance of this excellent virtue;
but Campbell never could be brought
to appreciate its full value. The
printing-press had difficulty in keeping
pace with the pen of Scott: to
wait for that of Campbell was equivalent
to a cessation of labour. Therefore
it is not surprising that, about
this period, most of his negotiations
failed. Proposals for an edition of
the British Poets, a large and expensive
work, to be executed jointly by
Scott and Campbell, fell to the ground:
and the bard of Hope gave vent to his
feelings by execrating the phalanx of
the Row.</p>

<p>At the very moment when his prospects
appeared to be shrouded in the
deepest gloom, Campbell received intimation
that he had been placed on
the pension-list as an annuitant of
£200. Never was the royal bounty
more seasonably extended; and this
high recognition of his genius seems
for a time to have inspired him with
new energy. He commenced the compilation
of the <cite>Specimens of British
Poets</cite>; but his indolent habits
overcame him, and the work was not
given to the public until <em>thirteen years</em>
after it was undertaken. No wonder
that the booksellers were chary of
staking their capital on the faith of
his promised performances!</p>

<p>Ten years after the publication of
the <cite>Pleasures of Hope</cite>, <cite>Gertrude of
Wyoming</cite> appeared. That exquisite
little poem demonstrated, in the most
conclusive manner, that the author's
poetical powers were not exhausted by
his earlier effort, and the same volume
contained the noblest of his immortal
lyrics. Campbell was now at the
highest point of his renown. Critics
may compare together the longer
poems, and, according as their taste
leans towards the didactic or the
descriptive form of composition, may
differ in awarding the palm of excellence,
but there can be but one opinion
as to the lyrical poetry. In this respect
Campbell stands alone among
his contemporaries, and since then he
has never been surpassed. <cite>Lochiel's
Warning</cite> and the <em>Battle of the Baltic</em>
were among the pieces then published;
and it would be difficult, out of the
whole mass of British poetry, to select
two specimens, by the same author,
which may fairly rank with these.</p>

<p>A new literary field was shortly
after this opened to Campbell. He was
engaged to deliver a course of lectures
on poetry at the Royal Institution of
London, and the scheme proved not
only successful but lucrative. In after
years he lectured repeatedly on the
belles lettres at Liverpool, Birmingham,
and other places, and the celebrity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
his name always commanded a crowd of
listeners. We learn from Dr Beattie,
that at two periods of his life it was proposed
to bring him forward as a candidate,
either for the chair of Rhetoric
or that of History in the University of
Edinburgh; but he seems to have
recoiled from the idea of the labour
necessary for the preparation of a
thorough academical course, a task
which his extreme natural fastidiousness
would doubtless have rendered
doubly irksome. Several more years,
a portion of which time was spent on
the Continent, passed over without any
remarkable result, until, at the age of
forty-three, Campbell entered upon
the duties of the editorship of the <em>New
Monthly Magazine</em>.</p>

<p>He held this situation for ten years,
and resigned it, according to his own
account, "because it was utterly impossible
to continue the editor without
interminable scrapes, together with a
law-suit now and then." In the interim,
however, certain important
events had taken place. In the first
place, he had published <em>Theodric</em>&mdash;a
poem which, in spite of a most laudatory
critique in the <em>Edinburgh Review</em>,
left a painful impression on the public
mind, and was generally considered
as a symptom either that the rich
mine of poesy was worked out, or
that the genius of the author had
been employed in a wrong direction.
In the second place, he took an active
share in the foundation of the London
University. He appears, indeed, to
have been the originator of the scheme,
and to have managed the preliminary
details with more than common skill
and prudence. It was mainly through
his exertions that it did not assume
the aspect of a mere sectarian institution,
bigoted in its principles and
circumscribed in its sphere of utility.
Shortly after this academical experiment,
he was elected Lord Rector of
the Glasgow University. Whatever
abstract value may be attached to
such an honour&mdash;and we are aware
that very conflicting opinions have
been expressed upon the point&mdash;this
distinction was one of the most gratifying
of all the tributes which were
ever rendered to Campbell. He found
himself preferred, by the students of
that university where his first aspirations
after fame had been roused, to
one of the first orators and statesmen
of the age; and his warm heart overflowed
with delight at the kindly compliment.
He resolved not to accept
the office as a mere sinecure, but
strictly to perform those duties which
were prescribed by ancient statute, but
which had fallen into abeyance by the
carelessness of nominal Rectors. He
entered as warmly into the feelings,
and as cordially supported the interests
of the students, as if the academical
red gown of Glasgow had been still
fresh upon his shoulders; and such
being the case, it is not surprising
that he was almost adored by his
youthful constituents. This portion
of the memoirs is very interesting: it
displays the character of Campbell in
a most amiable light; and the coldest
reader cannot fail to peruse with pleasure
the records of an ovation so
truly gratifying to the sensibilities of
the kind and affectionate poet. For
three years, during which unusual
period he held the office, his correspondence
with the students never
flagged; and it may be doubted whether
the university ever possessed a better
Rector.</p>

<p>In 1831 he took up the Polish cause,
and founded an association in London,
which for many years was the main
support of the unfortunate exiles who
sought refuge in Britain. The public
sympathy was at that time largely excited
in their favour, not only by the gallant
struggle which they had made for
regaining their ancient independence,
but from the subsequent severities perpetrated
by the Russian government.
Campbell, from his earliest years, had
denounced the unprincipled partition
of Poland; he watched the progress
of the revolution with an anxiety
almost amounting to fanaticism; and
when the outbreak was at last put
down by the strong hand of power,
his passion exceeded all bounds. Day
and night his thoughts were of Poland
only: in his correspondence he hardly
touched upon any other theme; and,
carried away by his zeal to serve the
exiles, he neglected his usual avocations.
The mind of Campbell was
naturally of an impulsive cast: but
the fits were rather violent than enduring.
This psychological tendency
was, perhaps, his most serious misfortune,
since it invariably prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
him from maturing the most important
projects he conceived. Unless
the scheme was such as could be executed
with rapidity, he was apt to halt
in the progress.</p>

<p>He next became engaged in a new
magazine speculation&mdash;<em>The Metropolitan</em>&mdash;which,
instead of turning
out, as he anticipated, a mine of
wealth, very nearly involved him in
serious pecuniary responsibility. After
this, his public career gradually became
less marked. The last poem
which he published, <em>The Pilgrim of
Glencoe</em>, exhibited few symptoms of
the fire and energy conspicuous in his
early efforts. "This work," says Dr
Beattie, "in one or two instances was
very favourably reviewed&mdash;in others,
the tone of criticism was cold and
austere; but neither praise nor censure
could induce the public to judge
for themselves; and silence, more fatal
in such cases than censure, took the
poem for a time under her wing. The
poet himself expressed little surprise
at the apathy with which his new
volume had been received; but whatever
indifference he felt for the influence
it might have upon his reputation,
he could not feel indifferent to
the more immediate effect which a
tardy or greatly diminished sale must
have upon his prospects as a householder.
'A new poem from the pen
of Campbell,' he was told, 'was as good
as a bill at sight;' but, from some
error in the drawing, as it turned out,
it was not negotiable; and the expenses
into which he had been led, by
trusting too much to popular favour,
were now to be defrayed from other
sources." It ought, however, to be
remarked, that he had now arrived at
his great climacteric. He was sixty-four
years of age, and his constitution,
never very robust, began to exhibit
symptoms of decay. Dr Beattie, who
had long watched him with affectionate
solicitude, in the double character
of physician and friend, thus notes his
observation of the change. "At the
breakfast or dinner table&mdash;particularly
when surrounded by old friends&mdash;he
was generally animated, full of anecdote,
and always projecting new
schemes of benevolence. But still
there was a visible change in his conversation:
it seemed to flow less freely;
it required an effort to support it; and
on topics in which he once felt a keen
interest, he now said but little, or remained
silent and thoughtful. The
change in his outward appearance was
still more observable; he walked with
a feeble step, complained of constant
chilliness; while his countenance, unless
when he entered into conversation,
was strongly marked with an expression
of languor and anxiety. The
sparkling intelligence that once animated
his features was greatly obscured;
he quoted his favourite authors
with hesitation&mdash;because, he told me,
he often could not recollect their
names."</p>

<p>The remainder of his life was spent
in comparative seclusion. Long before
this period he was left a solitary
man. His wife, whom he loved with
deep and enduring affection, was taken
away&mdash;one of his sons died in childhood,
and the other was stricken with
a malady which proved incurable.
But the kind offices of a nephew and
niece, and the attentions of many
friends, amongst whom Dr Beattie
will always be remembered as the
chief, soothed the last days of the
poet, and supplied those duties which
could not be rendered by dearer hands.
He expired at Boulogne, on 15th
June 1844, his age being sixty-seven,
and his body was worthily interred in
Westminster Abbey, with the honours
of a public funeral.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Never," says Beattie, "since the
death of Addison, it was remarked, had
the obsequies of any literary man been attended
by circumstances more honourable
to the national feeling, and more expressive
of cordial respect and homage, than
those of Thomas Campbell.</p>

<p>"Soon after noon, the procession began
to move from the Jerusalem Chamber to
Poet's Corner, and in a few minutes
passed slowly down the long lofty aisle&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Through breathing statues, then unheeded things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through rows of warriors, and through walks of kings.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">On each side the pillared avenues were
lined with spectators, all watching the
solemn pageant in reverential silence, and
mostly in deep mourning. The Rev.
Henry Milman, himself an eminent poet,
headed the procession; while the service
for the dead, answered by the deep-toned
organ, in sounds like distant thunder,
produced an effect of indescribable solemnity.
One only feeling seemed to pervade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the assembled spectators, and was
visible on every face&mdash;a desire to express
their sympathy in a manner suitable to
the occasion. He who had celebrated
the glory and enjoyed the favour of his
country for more than forty years, had
come at last to take his appointed chamber
in the Hall of Death&mdash;to mingle ashes
with those illustrious predecessors, who,
by steep and difficult paths, had attained
a lofty eminence in her literature, and
made a lasting impression on the national
heart."</p></blockquote>

<p>We observe that Dr Beattie has,
very properly, passed over with little
notice certain statements, emanating
from persons who styled themselves
the friends of Campbell, regarding his
habits of life during the latter portion
of his years. It is a misfortune incidental
to almost all men of genius,
that they are surrounded by a fry of
small literary adulators, who, in order
to magnify themselves, make a practice
of reporting every circumstance,
however trivial, which falls under
their observation, and who are not
always very scrupulous in adhering to
the truth. Campbell, who had the
full poetical share of vanity in his
composition, was peculiarly liable to
the attacks of such insidious worshippers,
and was not sufficiently careful
in the selection of his associates.
Hence imputations, not involving any
question of honour or morality, but
implying frailty to a considerable degree,
have been openly hazarded by
some who, in their own persons, are
no patterns of the cardinal virtues.
Such statements do no honour either
to the heart or the judgment of those
who devised them: nor would we have
even touched upon the subject, save
to reprobate, in the strongest manner,
these breaches of domestic privacy,
and of ill-judged and unmerited confidence.</p>

<p>A good deal of the correspondence
printed in these volumes is of a trifling
nature, and interferes materially with
the conciseness of the biography. We
do not mean to say that anything
objectionable has been included, but
there are too many notes and epistles
upon familiar topics, which neither
illustrate the peculiar tone of Campbell's
mind, nor throw any light whatever
upon his poetical history. But
the correspondence with his own family
is highly interesting. Nowhere
does Campbell appear in a higher and
more estimable point of view, than in
the character of son and brother.
Even in the hours of his darkest adversity,
we find him sharing his small
and precarious gains with his mother
and sisters; and they were in an equal
degree the participators of his better
fortunes. His fondness and consideration
for his wife and children are
most conspicuous; and many of his
letters regarding his boy, when "the
dark shadow" had passed across his
mind, are extremely affecting. Those
who have a taste for the modern style
of maundering about children, and the
perverted pictures of infancy so common
in our social literature, may not,
perhaps, see much to admire in the
following extract from a letter by
Campbell, announcing the birth of his
eldest child: to us it appears a pure
and exquisite picture:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This little gentleman all this while
looked to be so proud of his new station in
society, that he held up his blue eyes and
placid little face with perfect indifference
to what people about him felt or thought.
Our first interview was when he lay in
his little crib, in the midst of white muslin
and dainty lace, prepared by Matilda's
hands, long before the stranger's arrival.
I verily believe, in spite of my partiality,
that lovelier babe was never smiled upon
by the light of heaven. He was breathing
sweetly in his first sleep. I durst
not waken him, but ventured to give him
one kiss. He gave a faint murmur, and
opened his little azure lights. Since that
time he has continued to grow in grace
and stature. I can take him in my arms;
but still his good nature and his beauty
are but provocatives to the affection
which one must not indulge: he cannot
bear to be hugged, he cannot yet stand a
worrying. Oh! that I were sure he
would live to the days when I could take
him on my knee, and feel the strong
plumpness of childhood waxing into vigorous
youth. My poor boy! shall I have
the ecstasy to teach him thoughts and
knowledge, and reciprocity of love to me?
It is bold to venture into futurity so far!
at present his lovely little face is a comfort
to me; his lips breathe that fragrance
which it is one of the loveliest kindnesses
of Nature that she has given to infants&mdash;a
sweetness of smell more delightful than
all the treasures of Arabia. What adorable
beauties of God and Nature's bounty
we live in without knowing! How few
have ever seemed to think an infant beautiful!
But to me there seems to be a beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in the earliest dawn of infancy which is
not inferior to the attractions of childhood,
especially when they sleep. Their
looks excite a more tender train of emotions.
It is like the tremulous anxiety
which we feel for a candle new lighted,
which we dread going out."</p></blockquote>

<p>The sensibility, too, which he uniformly
exhibited towards those who
had shown him kindness, especially
his older and earlier friends, is exceedingly
pleasing. In writing to or
speaking of the Rev. Archibald Alison
and Dugald Stewart, his tone is one
of heartfelt, and almost filial, affection
and reverence; and amongst all the
benevolent actions performed by those
great and good men, there were few
to which they could revert with more
pleasure than to their seasonable patronage
of the young and sanguine
poet. With his literary contemporaries,
also, he lived upon good terms,&mdash;a
circumstance rather remarkable, for
Campbell, notwithstanding his good-nature,
was sufficiently touchy, and
keenly alive to satire or hostile criticism.
Excepting an early quarrel
with John Leyden, on the score of
some reported misrepresentation, a
temporary feud with Moore, which
was speedily reconciled, and a short
and unacrimonious disruption from
Bowles, we are not aware that he
ever differed with any of his gifted
brethren. He was upon the best
terms with Scott; and Dr Beattie has
given us several valuable specimens
of their mutual correspondence. With
Rogers he was intimate to the last:
and even the sarcastic and dangerous
Byron always mentioned him with
expressions of regard. Let us add,
moreover, that, whenever he had the
power, he was ready, even in instances
where his own interest might have
counselled otherwise, to lend a helping
hand to others who were struggling
for literary reputation. This generous
impulse was sometimes carried so far
as to injure him in his editorial capacity;
for, although fastidious to a degree
as to the quality of his own
writings, it was always with a sore
heart that he shut the door in the
face of a needy contributor.</p>

<p>The querulousness with which Campbell
complains throughout, of the cruel
treatment which he met with at the
hands of the publishers, would be
amusing if it were not at the same
time most unjust. He acknowledges,
in a letter written to Mr Richardson,
so late as 1812, that the sale of his
poems, for a series of years before, had
yielded him, on an average, £500 per
annum: not a bad annuity, we think,
as the proceeds of a couple of volumes!
We happen to know, moreover, that
by the first publication of <em>Gertrude</em>
Campbell made upwards of a thousand
pounds; and, unless we are grievously
misinformed, he received from Mr Murray,
for the copyright of the <em>Specimens</em>,
a similar sum, being double
the amount contracted for. We have
already mentioned the publication of
a subscription edition of the <em>Pleasures
of Hope</em>, "which," says Dr Beattie,
"with great liberality on the part of the
publishers, was to be brought out for
his own exclusive benefit." We should
not have alluded to these matters,
which, however, we believe, are no
secrets, but for the publication by Dr
Beattie of some very absurd expressions
used and reiterated by Campbell.
Such phrases as the following constantly
occur: "They are the greatest
ravens on earth with whom we have to
deal&mdash;liberal enough as booksellers go&mdash;but
still, you know, ravens, croakers,
suckers of innocent blood, and living
men's brains." Nor, in the opinion
of Campbell, were these outrages confined
merely to the living subjects, for
he says, in reference to the older
tenants of Parnassus, "Poor Bards!
you are all ill used, even after death,
by those who have lived upon your
brains. And now, having scooped
out those brains, they drink out of
them, like Vandals out of the skulls
of the severed and slain, served up by
a Gothic Ganymede!" Further, in
speaking of Napoleon, he says, " Perhaps
in my feelings towards the Gallic
usurper there may be some personal
bias; for I must confess that, ever
since he shot the bookseller in Germany,
I have had a warm side to him.
It was sacrificing an offering, by the
hand of genius, to the manes of the
victims immolated by the trade; and
I only wish we had Nap here for a
short time, to cut out a few of our own
cormorants." The fact is, that so far
from Campbell being ill-used by the
trade, they behaved towards him with
uncommon liberality. It is true that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in several instances, they hesitated in
making high terms for work not yet
commenced, with a man who was notoriously
deficient in punctuality and
perseverance; nor are they to be
blamed, when we consider the number
of his schemes, and the very few instances
in which these were brought
to maturity.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, though we
cannot bestow unqualified praise upon
Dr Beattie, for the manner in which
he has compiled these volumes, we
shall state that we have passed no
unprofitable hours in their perusal.
We rise from them with full appreciation
of the many excellent points
in the poet's character, with an augmented
regard for his memory on
account of the virtues so eminently
displayed, and with no lessened reverence
for the man in consequence of
the admitted foibles from which none
of the human family are exempt.
The book may be practically useful to
those who aspire to literary eminence,
and who are apt to rely too confidently
and implicitly on the powers
with which they are naturally gifted.
So long as Campbell was under restraint&mdash;so
long as he was subjected
to the wholesome discipline of the
University, and forced into the race of
emulation, we find that his genius
was largely and rapidly developed.
He was not a mere philological scholar,
though his attainments in Greek might
have put many a pedant to the blush;
but he improved his sense of beauty
and his taste by the contemplation of
the Attic flowers; and, without injuring
his style by any affectation
of antiquity unsuited to the tone of
his age, he adorned it by many of the
graces which are presented by the
ancient models. At Glasgow he
worked hard and won merited honours.
But afterwards, by abandoning
himself to a desultory course of study
and of composition, by never acting
upon the wise and sure plan of keeping
one object only steadily in view,
and persevering in spite of all difficulties
until that point was attained,&mdash;he
failed in realising the high expectations
which were justified by his
early promise. As it is, Campbell's
name is ranked high in the roll
of the British poets; but assuredly
he would have occupied a still more
exalted place, and also have avoided
much of that anxiety which at times
clouded his existence, if he had used
his fine natural gifts with but a
portion of the energy and determination
of his great compatriot, Scott.</p>

<p>In conclusion let us remark, that
however Dr Beattie may have erred
on the side of prolixity, by including
in the compass of the memoirs some
trifling and irrelevant matter, he is
more than concise whenever it is
necessary to allude to his own relationship
with Campbell. He has
made no parade whatever of his intimacy
with the poet; and no stranger,
in perusing these volumes, could discover
that to Beattie Campbell was
substantially indebted for many disinterested
acts of friendship, which
contributed largely to the comfort of
his declining years. This modesty is
a rare feature in modern biography;
and, when it does occur so remarkably
as here, we are bound to mention
it with special honour.</p>

<h2>THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR REFORMS.</h2>


<p>All over Europe, of late, we have
been hearing a great deal of universities
and students. The trencher-cap
has claimed a right to take its part in
the movements which make or mar
the destinies of nations, by the side
of plumed casque and priestly tiara.
Whether it was the beer of the
German burschen that "decocted
their cold blood to such valiant heat,"
or whether their practice in make-believe
duels had imparted a savage
appetite for foeman's blood in some
more genuine combat, or whether
Fichte's metaphysics had fairly muddled
their brains into delirium, certain
it is that they have, wheresoever
they could find an opportunity, been
foremost in the cause of demolition
and disorder, vied with and encouraged
the lowest of the rabble in
lawless aggressions, exulted in the
glow of blazing houses, and cried
havoc to rapine and murder.</p>

<p>It is curious that, while all this has
been going on in Europe, the attention
of the public should have been so
much occupied by the condition of our
English universities. Still more curious
is it, perhaps, that so large a
portion of the attention thus directed
should have assumed an objurgatory
tone, as if Oxford and Cambridge
were not duly performing their functions,
as if they were of a character
suited only to bygone ages, as if, in
short, they were doing nothing. True
enough, in one sense, they were
"doing nothing." There was no
academical legion formed&mdash;none, at
least, that we heard of&mdash;in Christchurch
Meadows or Trinity Walks;
no body of sympathising students
marched to London, with the view of
taking part in the democratic exhibitions
of the 10th of April. If Cuffey
is to be President of the British Republic,
he must search for the body-guard
of democracy elsewhere than on
the banks of the Cam and the Isis.
No doubt this excellent result is attributable,
in a great measure, to the
loyalty of the professional and middle
classes, from which our university
students principally spring. Their
feelings will naturally be akin to those
of their relations and friends. But
when, in so many other instances, we
see the academic population taking
the lead in the work of revolution,
beyond any spirit which exists among
their kindred, and urged on by a
democratic madness of purely academic
growth, we cannot help holding
that some credit on behalf of the loyalty
of English students is due to the
institutions by the influence of which
they are surrounded.</p>

<p>We are inclined to think that the
public have not been sufficiently alive
to this not unimportant difference
between Oxford and Heidelberg&mdash;Cambridge
and Vienna. Certes, but
little account was taken of the peaceful
bearing of our academic population.
On the contrary, much supercilious
wordiness has been lavished,
more or less to the discredit of cap
and gown, by portions of the London
press in the lead, and, as a necessary
consequence, by provincial journalists
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>. This talk, current now
for some years, was all concentrated
and endued with new vigour by a
movement of the University of Cambridge
itself. The people who stop
your way by talking of "progress,"
and deal out dark rhodomontade on
the subject of "enlightenment," were
all set agog by what they thought
a symptom of capitulation in the
strongholds of the Ancient. All our
old imbecile friends, the cant phrases
of twenty and thirty years ago, started
up as fresh as paint, ready to go
through all the handling they had before
endured. We heard of, "keeping
alive ancient prejudices," "cleaving
pertinaciously to obsolete forms,"
"following a monastic rule," "forgetting
the world outside their college
walls," and multifarious twaddle of this
sort, till the Pope fled from Rome,
or some other little revolution occurred
to withdraw the attention of the public
from this set of phrases to another,
no doubt not less forcible and original.
Others, again, took a friendly tone and
spoke apologetically: it was a great
thing to get any move at all from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
university: those who took the lead
in her management were not men who
mixed with the world at large, and
allowance must be made if they did
not altogether march with the times.
"The world at large" is an expression
of very doubtful import: "all
think their little set mankind:" but
when the resident fellows of colleges
are charged with not duly mixing with
the world at large, we cannot help
thinking that those who use the phrase
are ignoring the existence of the Didcot
Junction and Eastern Counties
Railway, and borrowing their ideas of
academic life from the time when
Hobson travelled "betwixt Cambridge
and the Bull." As far as our
observation goes, we should say that
there is no class of persons who have
better opportunities of taking an extended
view of different phases of
social being, or who are more disposed
to take advantage of those opportunities.
A fellow of a college is not
engaged much more than half the year
in university business; for four months,
at the very least, he generally has it
in his power to expatiate where he
will, from May Fair to Mesopotamia;
he has no household ties to detain him,
and if he does not rub off the lexicographic
rust, and the mathematical
mouldiness, which he may have contracted
during his labours of the term,
he must be possessed of a local attachment
almost vegetable: some few
instances of which secluded existence
still linger in quiet nooks of our halls
and colleges, but which are no more
the types of their class than Parson
Trulliber is a representative of the
country clergy, or the stage Diggory
of the English yeoman. But the self-complacency
of Cockneyism is the
most unshaken thing in this revolutionary
age. It is perfectly ready to
lecture the parson on the teaching of
Greek, or the Yorkshire farmer on the
fattening of bullocks. All the distributive
machinery in the world does
not diminish, it would seem, the absorption
of intelligence by the Ward of
Cheap.</p>

<p>We are not, however, surprised that
the conclusions, on which we have remarked,
should be those arrived at by
the large class of small observers
whose phraseology we have quoted.
The bustling man of business, who
takes his day-ticket to Oxford or
Cambridge, is of course struck by seeing
a number of usages, for the original
of which, if he inquire, he is
referred back to hoar mediæval times&mdash;times
which his Cockney guides dispose
of by some such phrase as crass
ignorance, or feudal barbarism. He
is naturally surprised at such things;
he never saw anything like it before;
they don't do so in Mincing Lane, or
even in Gower Street. He can hardly
be expected to view these matters in
their relation to the system of which
they form a part; he can hardly be
expected to realise in them the symbols
through which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</i>
finds an utterance and exerts an
agency; and so he goes smiling home
in his railway carriage, and perhaps
buys a number of <cite>Punch</cite> by the way,
and thinks that there is more practical
wisdom in that periodical than is embodied
in the great monuments of
William of Wykeham or Lady Margaret.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while we rebut these
vague general charges of a blind impassibility
to the influences of the
time, we are far from denying that a
tendency to cling to ancient ideas and
observances is a characteristic of the
universities. This tendency is a property
of all corporate institutions,
and is commonly the reason of their
foundation. They are to perpetuate
to a future time a feeling or design of
the present; to form a nucleus, round
which the thoughts and principles of
one age congregate, and are thus
handed down to another in a preserved
and crystallised form. Changes of
ideas pass upon them of necessity,
through the individual liability of
their constituent members to be
affected by the current of the passing
time; but these changes take place
rather by a gradual fusion of the old
into the new, than by those sudden
transitions to which the popular and
prevailing opinions are so often subjected.
And it may fairly be supposed
that, by means of this property,
corporations are more likely to adopt
and amalgamate into their framework
that which is most permanent and
genuine, out of all that the ever-changing
tide of time casts upon the
shore.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, this tenacity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
bygone will more naturally be found
to be a characteristic of the universities,
than of other corporations. The
spots which they occupy are holy
ground, fraught with historic memories
of the great and wise of former
days. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genius loci</i> is a mighty
advocate in behalf of antiquity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As the ghost of Homer clings<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Round Scamander's wasting springs;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As divinest Shakspeare's might<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fills Avon and the world with light;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">&mdash;so we may not well pass unaffected
by the congregation of priest, and
poet, and sage, whose recollections
consecrate the banks of our academic
rivers. As we go beneath "Bacon's
mansion," or about Milton's mulberry
tree; as we kneel where Newton
knelt, or dine in halls where the portraits
of Erasmus, and Fisher, and
Taylor, look down upon us,&mdash;these are
not times and places for the dogmatism
and arrogance of "the nineteenth
century"&mdash;for bragging of our advance
and illumination, or sneering at "the
good old times." This is in accordance
with the law of our nature; but
these recollections, and the lessons
which they teach, are not, if rightly
laid hold of, such as to induce a mere
blind attachment to the skeletons of
dead notions and practices. And
although it may, perhaps must, happen
that, at any given time, there may
be found relics adhering to the system,
whose vitality and meaning have been
withdrawn by time, and left them
dry and sapless, yet we will venture
to assert that, if a dogged adherence
to antiquated forms could fairly be
charged on the universities, they could
never have maintained their ground
amidst the mighty historical transmutations
that have passed over their heads.
Civil wars and popular tumults have
raged around them; the throne has
yielded to violence and to intrigue;
the Church has admitted modifications,
both of her doctrine and her discipline;
and, more than all, the still
more important, though silent and
gradual changes&mdash;changes to which
the striking and salient events of
history are but the indexes and visible
signs&mdash;changes of thought and rule of
action&mdash;have risen and sunk, and
ebbed and flowed, and still these stable
monuments of the piety and munificence
of men whose names are almost
unknown, remain unshorn of their
ancient vigour, and intimately entwined
with our social system.</p>

<p>But it is time that we should come
to particulars, and make known to
our readers, as briefly as we can, the
nature of the alterations recently introduced
at Cambridge, which have
called forth so much objurgatory commendation
from quarters, which were
commonly considered to entertain
tolerably destructive views in regard
to the universities. We say objurgatory
commendation, because the faint
praise of a "move in the right direction"
was generally more or less coupled
with vigorous denunciation of the antiquated
obstinacy which had so long
kept in the wrong. And here we
must premise the statement of certain
qualities of the age in which we live,
which will have fallen under the
notice of all observers. Perhaps
the most distinguishing feature of our
time is the principle which forms
the life and soul of retail trade&mdash;the
principle which sets men to
busy themselves about small and
immediate returns for outlay; which
looks more to the gains across the
counter, than to the advantage which
is general, or distant, or future. In a
word, <em>practicality</em> is the ruling passion
of our day. As might have been expected,
education, among other things,
has been subjected to this huckstering
test. People have asked, what is the
market value of this or that branch
of learning? Will it get a boy on in
the world? Will it enable him to
provide for himself soon? Will the
returns for the expenditure I am
going to make be quick and certain?
Cowper represents the father of a son
intended for the church as speculating
on his young hopeful's prospects after
the following fashion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let reverend churls his ignorance rebuke,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who starve upon a dog's-eared Pentateuch,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The parson knows enough who knows a duke."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noind">In these days the acquaintance of a
duke is not of the same relative value
as it was when Cowper wrote; but
this sort of worldly-wise calculation
is more prevalent than ever, and the
cry of the largest class of the public
is&mdash;give us such knowledge as will <em>pay</em>.
Those who took this commercial view
of education derived no small encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
from the circumstance that
Prince Albert, the learned field-marshal,
and warlike chancellor of Cambridge
University, had interfered
to promote the culture of modern
languages in these venerable precincts
of Eton, where for many a
year Henry's holy shade had watched
the growth of an education of less obvious
utility. How was young Thomas
or William "the better off" for
being able to con "the tale of Troy divine?"
But teach him to mince a little
French, simper a little Italian, snarl a
little German, and there he is at once
accomplished for an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">attaché</i>, a correspondent,
or a bagman&mdash;profitable
walks of life all of them. And the same
notions mounted still higher in the ascendant,
when the senate of the University
of Cambridge apparently evinced
a desire to examine the requirements
of that body by the same standard.</p>

<p>The first step of this kind was taken
about three years ago. Most of our
readers are aware that, at Cambridge,
those candidates for a degree who do
not aspire to honours are said to go
out in the <em>poll</em>; this being the abbreviated
term to denote those who were
classically designated ὁι πολλοι. Now
the qualifications required for attaining
this poll degree consisted of an
acquaintance with a part of Homer,
a part of Virgil, a part of the Greek
Testament, and Paley's <cite>Evidences of
Christianity</cite>, over and above the mathematics,
of which we shall speak
presently. By what curious infelicity
the recondite, and, in many particulars,
inexplicable language of Homer
has been so commonly selected for
beginners in Greek at school, and,
as in this case, for those who were not
expected to appear as accomplished
scholars&mdash;we need not here stop to
inquire. Suffice it to say that the
university, in this initial reform,
ousted Homer and Virgil from the
course, and supplied their places with
a Latin and Greek author, to be varied
in each successive year. This was
decidedly an improvement, at least as
regards Homer, for the reason we have
alluded to above. Perhaps a better
innovation would have been to have
followed the Oxford system, and allowed
to the student a choice of his
author. But it is a great misfortune
that the university, in recasting this
course, did not substitute a work of
some one of the logical or philosophical
authors current in the English
language, for the shallow and plausible
book of Paley's above mentioned&mdash;with
regard to which it would be
difficult to say whether it is worse
chosen as a model of reasoning, or as
a proof of Christian facts.</p>

<p>The mathematical portion of this
course consisted of Euclid, algebra,
and trigonometry, the student being
thus trained in the model processes of
pure mathematical reasoning left us
by the first, and also brought acquainted
with the elementary operations
of analysis. As a matter of
mental training, the most valuable
portion of this curriculum was the
knowledge acquired of the geometrical
processes employed by Euclid, as
familiarising the mind of the student
with the severest forms of reasoning,
and the steps whereby indubitable
verity is attained. This portion, however,
was most especially selected for
curtailment by the reforms to which
we are alluding. In the stead of the
requirements thus displaced, a motley
amount of elementary propositions
in statics, dynamics, and hydrostatics,
were substituted&mdash;useful information
enough as instances of the simpler
applications of the analytical machinery
of mathematics, but comparatively
worthless as an exercise of the
mind. Country clergymen, whose
forgotten mathematics loomed grandly
on their minds through the mist of
years, were confounded with disappointment
at beholding their sons, in
whom they expected to find philosophers,
return to them with an examination
paper, apparently rather calculated
to unfold the mysteries of engineering,
well-sinking, and carpentering.</p>

<p>This object&mdash;the practicability and
immediate utility of the studies pursued,
in preference to the superiority
of mental training derivable from
them&mdash;seems to be simply that which
has dictated the recent innovations of
1848. The principle which entered
into both measures may easily be
traced in the prevalent phases of
literature and science throughout the
public at large. A few years ago,
every one fancied himself a philosopher.
Little volumes, cabinet cyclopædias
and the like, swarmed on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
booksellers' shelves, containing a
string of disjointed and bald scientific
facts, involving no truth and expressive
of no law, but more or less
adroitly arranged under several heads,
with a <em>savant</em> air. The man of business&mdash;the
apprentice&mdash;the boarding-school
miss&mdash;took it into their heads
that a royal road was thus opened to
all branches of useful and entertaining
knowledge,&mdash;that the acquirements of
Bacon were "in this wonderful age"
brought within the reach of every one
who had an occasional hour or two in
the day to spare from more mechanical
employments; and that the progress
from ignorance to philosophy was as
much facilitated by these little-book
contrivances, as the journey from London
to Birmingham, by the rushing
railway-train, was an advance upon
the week's toil of our forefathers in
accomplishing the same space. Much
of this mania for desultory knowledge
has evaporated, but its influences are
still distinctly to be traced among us.
It is not surprising that those influences
should in some measure have
affected the universities. In accordance
with the popular notions afloat,
the Cambridge legislators followed up
the alteration which we have been
describing by the adoption of their
recent measures, by which they
effected an extension of their field of
"honours" similar to that which they
had already accomplished in the qualifications
for the ordinary degree.
To the old "triposes," or classes of
honours in mathematics and classics,
they have now added two more&mdash;namely,
one in moral sciences and
one in natural sciences.</p>

<p>Before, however, we offer any conjectures
as to the probable effect of
these yet untried changes, we must
remind our readers of a certain characteristic
of the Cambridge system,
which is important in estimating the
internal relations of the late reforms.
The academic life of Cambridge circulates
through two concurrent systems,
which we may term the university
and the collegiate system.
The university is one corporation, and
each individual college is altogether
another. The union between the two
systems might be dissolved without
difficulty. If the university were to
abandon her ancient seat, and take
up some new abode, as she did for a
time at Northampton some centuries
ago, the colleges might still remain
as places of education, with but little
modification of their present character.
The older system&mdash;the university&mdash;has
had its functions gradually
absorbed in a great measure by the
collegiate. The earliest form in which
Cambridge appears, dimly seen in
hoar antiquity, is that of a congregation
of students, commonly living
together for mutual convenience in
hostels, governed by a code of statutes,
and endowed with the privilege of
granting degrees. Then came the
founders of colleges, with their noble
endowments, and reared edifices, in
which societies of these students
should live together under a common
rule, and form distinct corporations
by themselves, for purposes connected
with, and auxiliary to, those of the
university. The latter body has from
time immemorial matriculated only
those who were already members of
some one or other of the colleges; but
there probably was a time at which a
student in the university was not
necessarily a member of any college,
until by degrees these foundations
absorbed into their composition the
whole of the academic population.
By-and-by, the principal part of the
functions of teaching also lapsed into
the hands of the colleges. In the old
times, the university discharged this
duty by means of the public readings
or lectures by the newly admitted
masters of arts, (termed <em>regents</em>,) and
by the keeping of acts and opponencies&mdash;being
certain <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivâ voce</i> disputations&mdash;by
the students. To this system,
comprehending the main studies of
the place, was superadded, by individual
endowment or royal beneficence,
the collateral information on
special subjects given by the professors.
The colleges were altogether
subsidiary to this mode of instruction&mdash;the
practice being that every student
who enrolled himself in the ranks of
a particular college, must do so under
the charge of some one of the fellows
of the college, who became a kind of
private tutor to him. Hence arose
college tutors; and as their lectures,
given in each separate college, were
found to be the most efficient aids in
prosecuting the university studies, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
readings of the masters of arts gradually
fell altogether into disuse, and
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivâ voce</i> exercises of the students
have nearly done so.</p>

<p>Possibly, along with the transfer of
the functions of lecturing from the
university regents to the college tutors,
the professorial chairs may also have
declined in importance as an element
of the academic education. But, as we
have before seen, these were never the
main vehicle for the dispensation of
knowledge on the part of the university.
Nevertheless, we suspect that
one object of the recently erected triposes
is to revive the importance of
the professors' lectures in the university
course. For it is now required
that every one who presents himself
as a candidate for the ordinary or <em>poll</em>
degree, shall have attended the lectures
of some one of the professors at
his individual choice; and these lectures
will, moreover, be necessary
guides in the studies required of those
who aim at the honours of the new
triposes. It seems clear, therefore,
that the devisers of the scheme had it
in contemplation, through the medium
of their changes, to fill the class-rooms
of the professors, and so far to assimilate
the modern system to the ancient,
by bringing the university instruction
into more active play. We are disposed
to question the wisdom of these
proceedings. Until now, the university
and the colleges had apportioned
their several functions, by assigning
to the latter the duty of imparting proficiency
in the studies cultivated; to
the former, that of testing proficiency
attained. The two systems had
thus harmonised, as we believe, in
conformity with the requirements of
the age by lapse of time; and if it
was deemed desirable to disturb this
arrangement, and restore the faculty
of teaching to the university, this
should rather have been done, we
think, by reviving the system of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vivâ
voce</i> disputations, now altogether disused
except in the progress to a degree
in law, physic, or divinity; but which
would form, under proper regulations,
an important adjunct to the ordinary
course, by cultivating a decision, a
readiness, and an ingenuity in reasoning,
which are comparatively left dormant
by a written examination. Again,
it is, as we consider, altogether a mistake
to suppose that the primary end
of a professorial existence is to deliver
lectures. The endowment of a professorship
is rather, as we take it, to
enable the holder of it to give up his
time to the particular science to which
he is devoted; and it is by no means
necessary, especially in these days,
when words are so easily winged by
the printer's devil, that the results of
his labours should be given forth by
oral lectures. At the same time, when
his subject, and his manner of treating
it, were such as to command interest,
he was at no loss for an audience. The
professorships, however, being mostly
established for the purpose of aiding
the pursuit of the inductive sciences,
side by side with the severer studies of
the university, fell under the patronage
of the spirit of the age. Whether
the sciences, for the promotion of
which they were founded, will be
materially advanced by this sort of
"protection," remains to be seen.</p>

<p>It is likely enough, we think, that
some confusion may arise from this
revival of the lecturing powers of the
university. This, however, will be
easily obviated in practice, as the two
systems have never, so far as we are
aware, manifested anything like a
mutual antagonism or jealousy of each
other. A greater practical difficulty is
one which appears to be left untouched
by the new regime. We allude to
the growing plan of instruction by
private tutors&mdash;a calling which has
sprang up, in the strictest principles of
demand and supply, to meet the eagerness
for external aid which has been
induced by the great competition for
university honours. The existence
and increasing importance of the class
of private tutors has been decried as an
evil; and it, no doubt, enhances considerably
the expenses attendant on a
college education. But, after all, this
is only part and parcel of the lot which
has fallen to us in these latter days
of merry England. There are so
many of us, and we keep so constantly
adding to our numbers, that
we must not be surprised at more
pushing and contrivance being required
to realise a livelihood than heretofore;
and as the end to be attained increases
in its relative importance, the outlay
attendant on its attainment will, in the
ordinary course of things, be augmented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
also. It is not our intention,
however, to discuss at this time the
merits or demerits of the private-tutor
system; it suffices for our purpose to
notice it as the reappearance, in another
form, of the old functions of instruction,
as lodged in the hands of the
university regents. As the collegiate
system gradually supplanted that
pristine form, so the office of the
private tutors is, to a certain extent,
supplanting the collegiate system.
These instructors are likely, as we before
said, to occupy, under the new
rules, much the same place as they
held under the old; and indeed it
appears that, whether desirable or not,
it would be extremely difficult to get
rid of them; at all events the colleges,
being now trenched upon by the
university professors on the one
hand, and by the private tutors on
the other, must exert themselves to
ascertain their proper functions, and
to fulfil them with zeal and energy.</p>

<p>As for the new triposes themselves,
it may be doubted whether the name
given to them is not the most unfortunate
part of them. The common
name of Tripos looks like a confusion
of ideas on the part of the university
itself, and a want of discrimination
between its old studies and its new.
At first, probably, the recent triposes
will be comparatively neglected, and
on that ground alone it is both misjudging
and unfair to include in the
same category of "honours" and
"tripos," classes which are respectively
the subject of ardent competition
and of none at all. But supposing
that the new classes attracted
their fair share of competitors, it
would still be a grievous fault in the
university to hold out to the world
so false an estimate of the vehicle of
mental training, as it would appear
to do by placing on a par the new
studies and the old&mdash;by assuming, or
seeming to assume, that ratiocinative
thought may be as well employed
about the fallacies of Mr Ricardo, as
the exact reasoning and indubitable
verities of Euclid and Newton; or
that the faculties of discrimination
and speculation may be unfolded by
the "getting up" of botanical or
chemical nomenclature, not less than
by the new world of thought opened
through the authors of Greece and
Rome. We must, however, confess
that we are now taking the most
unfavourable view of the matter.
With respect, indeed, to the natural
sciences' tripos, we cannot help being
fully of opinion, that it should have
been distinctly recognised as subsidiary
to the main vehicles of education
adopted at Cambridge. But the
moral sciences' tripos furnishes, if
properly constructed, an excellent
means for training thought. It is a
great misfortune that the study of
Aristotle has been suffered at Cambridge
to fall almost into desuetude:
we speak of the philosophical study
of his works in contradistinction to
the philological. The former is
maintained at Oxford with great
success; thus combining, with Oxford
scholarship, a training of the reasoning
powers which is almost an equivalent
for the mathematical studies
of her sister university. Moreover,
the literature of Great Britain boasts
of a band of moral philosophers far
greater than any other modern nation
can produce. The works of Butler,
Cudworth, Berkeley, Hume, Reid,
and Stewart, with many others, form
a group of authorities worthy of the
groves of Academus. The metaphysics
of Locke&mdash;we should rather
say, the wall which Locke has built
up between the English mind and the
science of metaphysics&mdash;has too long
prevented the moral reasoners of this
country from duly availing themselves
of the treasures at their command.
Under the guidance of such lights as
those we have enumerated, we may
hope to see a school of metaphysical
thinkers arise in England, whose exertions
may dissipate the mist of
half-thought in which Teutonic speculation
has involved the science of its
choice. If, however, the tap-root of
our metaphysical thought is to be cut
through by the study of the plausibilities
of Locke and Paley, (no very
unlikely issue, we should fear, at least
under present circumstances,) then
this moral sciences' tripos also is one
of those things which had better never
have been.</p>

<p>We repeat that Cambridge has incurred
great blame, if she has allowed
herself to mislead, or to seem to mislead,
the popular mind on these matters.
The more talkative portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the public, and the newspapers which
commonly represent that more talkative
portion, have evidently been inclined
to interpret this movement of
Cambridge as an indication of a most
utilitarian system of education coming
to supplant the old rules. They
anticipate all sorts of civil engineering,
butterfly-dissecting, light geology,
and a whole Babel of modern languages,
to be victoriously let loose on
the home where for many a century
Wisdom has sat with the scroll of Plato
on her knee, and Science has unravelled
the wizard lore of fluxion and equation.
The senate of Cambridge is
egregiously mistaken if it supposes
that it will win over to its body the
students of these popular branches of
knowledge, by following the dictation
of the popular taste. Those who want
to be civil engineers will not come to
a university to learn their art. They
will follow Brunel and Stephenson,
and see how the work is actually done
in practice; and those who do so will
soon prove themselves far superior,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad</i> civil engineering, to the Cambridge-bred
theorist. In like manner,
a month's flirtation in Paris,
or a few games at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écarté</i> with a
German baron, will teach the student
of modern languages more French
or German than all the philologists
of Oxford, Cambridge, or Eton can
impart in a year.</p>

<p class="center">
"Quam quisque nôrit artem, in hâc se exerceat."<br />
</p>

<p class="noind">If the public have mistaken the functions
of the university, it is the more
incumbent on her to assert them correctly.
Nor is the outcry less groundless,
that the universities have failed
to furnish the best men in law
and medicine. With regard to the
law, certain gentlemen were even cited
by name, in leading articles of newspapers,
as types of the class of men
who were now taking the lead at the
bar, and representing an altogether
different school from that trained at
the universities. The fact of the university
men being supplanted, or being
likely to be supplanted, at the bar,
may admit of considerable question.
But it is not, after all, the question
by which the universities are to be
judged. They do not undertake to
make men great lawyers or skilful
physicians; this, where it does belong
to their functions, is a collateral duty,
and not the main object of their training.
That object is distinctly avowed
in their own formularies. That noble
clause in the "bidding prayer" will attach
itself to the memories of most of
those who have heard it:</p>

<p>"<em>And that there never may be wanting
a supply of persons duly qualified
to serve God, both in Church and State</em>,
let us pray for a blessing on all seminaries
of sound learning and religious
education, particularly the universities
of this realm."</p>

<p>A higher end to be attained, perhaps,
than that of merely qualifying
the student to "get on in the world."
His university education is not so
much to enable him to attain those
eminent stations which are the prizes
of ability and industry, as to fit him to
adorn and fill worthily those stations
when he has attained them. In truth,
we think it is not desirable, any more
than necessary, that a degree should
be an essential opening to the bar, the
profession of medicine, or even the
Church. The university is injured by
being too much regarded as a step to
be got over with the view of reaching
some ulterior end.</p>

<p>We dwell on this point with the
more interest, because we are satisfied
that a still greater responsibility
rests with the universities, to guard
the fountains of knowledge pure and
unsullied, in those days of professed
knowledge, than in the so-called dark
ages. Our day is rich in the knowledge
of <em>facts</em>; there were many <em>truths</em>
influencing those men of the times
we please to call dark, which we have
ignored or forgotten. The general
demand for information&mdash;for this
knowledge of facts&mdash;has made it a
marketable commodity, a subject of
commercial speculation; consequently,
a vast deal that is shallow and desultory,
a vast deal, too, that is counterfeit
and fraudulent, is abroad, made
up for the market, and circulates
among multitudes who are incapable
of separating the grain from the chaff.
It is therefore, we repeat, even more
important that the sources of learning
should be guarded from contamination,
now that the antagonistic principles
are the knowledge of truth and the
subserviency to falsehood, than when,
at the revival of literature, the struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
was between knowledge and ignorance.</p>

<p>We would have the universities remember
that it is their best policy as
corporations, as well as a duty they
owe to those great medieval spirits
who planted them where they stand,
to own a better principle than that
which would lead them to succumb to
what is called popular opinion&mdash;in other
words, the floating fallacy of the day&mdash;and
aim at producing the shallow
party leaders and favourite writers of
the passing moment. They cannot
control the frothy surface and the
deep under-current at the same time.
It would be a sacrifice to expediency
which, after all, would not serve their
turn. There are institutions which
will do that work, and which will beat
them in the race. Let all such take
their own course.</p>

<p>"Let Gryll be Gryll, and have his
hoggish kinde:" let Stinkomalee train
the statesmen for the League and the
jokers for <cite>Punch</cite>,&mdash;but Oxford and
Cambridge have other rôles.</p>

<p>It is true, we are told there is a new
aristocracy rising in England, and that
the English universities are gaining no
hold upon the coming generation of
"chiefs of industry." It would be far
better for our social condition that
these same chiefs of industry should
be educated men, and should pass
through a training which might tend
to neutralise the power of the mercantile
iron in entering into their soul.
But at present the race to be rich is
so strong and hardly contested, that
this class is hardly likely, in general,
to devote their scions to academical
studies of any description; and the
merchant or manufacturer who came
from the banks of Isis or Cam, at the
age of twenty-one, to the Exchange
or the Cloth-hall, would find himself
starting under a most heavy disadvantage
as compared with his neighbour
of the same age, who had spent
the last three or four years in a counting-house.
The reason that this class
is not commonly trained in the national
seminaries, is to be sought in the
habit and requirements of the class,
and not in the nature of the education
afforded them.</p>

<p>We have spoken chiefly of Cambridge,
because Cambridge has put
herself forward as the representative
of a system of so-called university reform&mdash;of
a certain movement in the
direction of that principle which would
accommodate the education of our
higher classes to the caprice of a popular
cry or cant phrase. We care not
so much whether that movement in
itself be advantageous or the reverse:
it is against the principles supposed
to be involved in it that we protest.
The report goes, that changes of some
kind or other are contemplated at
Oxford also. If these changes be
made, we trust that they will not be
devised in deference to the noisier
portion of the public, or to that fondness
for short-cuts to knowledge,
which fritters away the energies of the
rising man in the collection of desultory
facts, and the dependence upon
shallow plausibilities. The Scottish
universities, too, are likely to be put
to the test in the same manner as their
sisters of the Southern kingdom; and
the questions raised cannot be uninteresting
to them.</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, can the whole nation
be otherwise than deeply concerned
in this matter; and we are not surprised,
at the interest which has been excited
by the recent alterations at Cambridge,
though not measures in themselves
of any great importance. While
we have contended for a higher ground
on the part of the universities than
that of merely finding such knowledge
as is required by the popular taste,
and happens to be most current in
the market, and have called upon
them to lead the public mind in these
matters, we need hardly say that we
must not be understood as failing to
see the necessity of those institutions
closely observing the shifting relations
of our social equilibrium, and adapting
their policy by judicious change, if
need be, to the circumstances in which
they find themselves. We might
perhaps adduce the altered position of
the Church with respect to the nation
at large, as an instance of these
changes. We have before hinted
that the universities have, as we
think, in some degree aimed at being
too exclusively the training-schools
of the clergy; and this circumstance,
in our judgment, so far as England is
concerned, has both narrowed the
operations of the Church and the
influence of the universities. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Church and European civilisation&mdash;the
latter having grown up under the
tutelage of the former&mdash;stand no
longer in the relation of nurse and
bantling, though Heaven forbid that
they should ever be other than firm
friends and allies! But the Church
is no longer the exclusive teacher of
the world: mankind are in a great
measure taught by books. Viewing
the clergy not in respect of their
sacerdotal functions, but as the instructors
of mankind, we find their
office shared by a motley crowd of
authors, pamphleteers, newspaper
editors, magazine contributors, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quales
nos vel Cluvienus</i>. It is incumbent,
then, on the universities to consider
how they may bring within the sphere
of that control which they exercised
in old times over the clergy, this
mixed multitude of public instructors;
how they may become not
merely the schools of the clerical
order, but also the nurseries of a future
caste of literary men, who are to bear
their part with that order in the coming
development of human thought.</p>

<h2>THE COVENANTERS' NIGHT-HYMN.</h2>

<h3>BY DELTA.</h3>


<p>[Making all allowances for the many over-coloured pictures, nay, often
onesided statements of such apologetic chroniclers as Knox, Melville,
Calderwood, and Row, it is yet difficult to divest the mind of a strong
leaning towards the old Presbyterians and champions of the Covenant&mdash;probably
because we believe them to have been sincere, and know
them to have been persecuted and oppressed. Nevertheless, the liking
is as often allied to sympathy as to approbation; for a sifting of motives
exhibits, in but too many instances, a sad commixture of the chaff of
selfishness with the grain of principle&mdash;an exhibition of the over and over
again played game, by which the gullible many are made the tools of the
crafty and designing few. Be it allowed that, both in their preachings from
the pulpit and their teachings by example, the Covenanters frequently proceeded
more in the spirit of fanaticism than of sober religious feeling; and
that, in their antagonistic ardour, they did not hesitate to carry the persecutions
of which they themselves so justly complained into the camp of the
adversary&mdash;sacrificing in their mistaken zeal even the ennobling arts of architecture,
sculpture, and painting, as adjuncts of idol-worship&mdash;still it is to be
remembered, that the aggression emanated not from them; and that the rights
they contended for were the most sacred and invaluable that man can possess&mdash;the
freedom of worshipping God according to the dictates of conscience.
They sincerely believed that the principles which they maintained were right:
and their adherence to these with unalterable constancy, through good report
and through bad report; in the hour of privation and suffering, of danger and
death; in the silence of the prison-cell, not less than in the excitement of the
battle-field; by the blood-stained hearth, on the scaffold, and at the stake,&mdash;forms
a noble chapter in the history of the human mind&mdash;of man as an
accountable creature.</p>

<p>Be it remembered, also, that these religious persecutions were not mere
things of a day, but were continued through at least three entire generations.
They extended from the accession of James VI. to the English throne, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testibus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the rhymes of Sir David Lyndsay, and the classic prose of Buchanan,)
down to the Revolution of 1688&mdash;almost a century, during which many thousands
tyrannically perished, without in the least degree loosening that tenacity
of purpose, or subduing that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perfervidum ingenium</i>, which, according to
Thuanus, have been national characteristics.</p>

<p>As in almost all similar cases, the cause of the Covenanters, so strenuously
and unflinchingly maintained, ultimately resulted in the victory of Protestantism&mdash;that
victory, the fruits of which we have seemed of late years so readily
inclined to throw away; and, in its rural districts more especially, of nothing
are the people more justly proud than</p>

of his peculiar genius.</p>

<h2>THE CARLISTS IN CATALONIA.</h2>


<p>The debates in the Cortes, and the
increasing development of the civil war
in Catalonia, have again called attention
to the affairs of Spain. Three
months ago we glanced at the state
of that country, briefly and broadly
sketching its political history since the
royal marriages. The quarter of a
year that has since elapsed has been a
busy one in Spain. Two things have
been clearly proved: first, that the
Carlist insurrection is a very different
affair from the paltry gathering of banditti,
as which the Moderados and their
newspapers so long persisted in depicting
it; and, secondly, that the
Madrid government are heartily
repentant of their unceremonious
dismissal of a British ambassador.
Christina and her Camarilla scarcely
know which most deeply to deplore&mdash;the
intrusion of Cabrera or the expulsion
of Bulwer.</p>

<p>In Catalonia, we have a striking
example of what may be accomplished,
under most unfavourable
circumstances, by one man's energy
and talent. Nine months ago there
was not a single company of Carlist
soldiers in the field. A few irregular
bands, insignificant in numbers, without
uniform and imperfectly armed,
roamed in the mountains, fearing to
enter the plain, hunted down like
wolves, and punished as malefactors
when captured. To persons ignorant
how great was the difference made by
the fall of Louis Philippe in the
chances of the Spanish Carlists, the
cause of these never appeared more
hopeless than in the spring of 1848.
Suddenly a man, who for seven years
had basked in the orange groves of
Hyères, and listlessly lingered in the
mountain solitudes of Auvergne,&mdash;reposing
his body, scarred and weary
from many a desperate combat, and
recruiting his health, impaired by
exertion and hardship&mdash;crossed the
Pyrenees, and appeared upon the
scene of his former exploits. The
news of his arrival spread fast, but for
a time found few believers. Cabrera,
said the incredulous, who evacuated
Spain at the head of ten thousand
hardy and well-armed soldiers, because
he would not condescend to a
guerilla warfare, after having held
towns and fortresses, and won pitched
battles in the field&mdash;Cabrera would
never re-enter the country to take
command of a few hundred scattered
adventurers. Others denied his presence,
because he had not immediately
signalised it by some dashing
feat, worthy the conqueror of Morella
and Maella. Various reports were
circulated by those interested to discredit
the arrival of the redoubted
chief. He was ill, they said; he had
never entered Spain or dreamed of so
doing; he had come to Catalonia,
others admitted, but was so disgusted
at the scanty resources of his party,
at the few men in the field, at the
lack of arms, money, organisation,&mdash;of
everything, in short, necessary for the
prosecution of a war,&mdash;that he cursed
the lying representations which had
lured him from retirement, and was
again upon the wing for France. The
truth was in none of these statements.
If Cabrera sounded a retreat in 1840,
when ten thousand warlike and devoted
followers were still at his orders,
it was because the Carlist <em>prestige</em> was
gone for a time, the country was
exhausted by war, anarchy reigned in
the camp, and he himself was prostrated
by sickness. In seven years, circumstances
had entirely changed; the
country, galled by misgovernment and
oppression, was ripe for insurrection;
the intermeddling of foreign powers
was no longer to be apprehended; and
Cabrera emerged from his retirement,
not expecting to find an army, or
money, or organisation, but prepared
to create all three. In various ingenious
and impenetrable disguises
he moved rapidly about eastern Spain;
fearlessly entering the towns, visiting
his old partisans, and reviving their
dormant zeal by ardent and confident
speech; giving fresh spirit to the
timid, shaming the apathetic, and
enlisting recruits. His unremitting
efforts were crowned with success.
Numbers of his former followers rallied
round him; secret adherents of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
cause contributed funds; arms and
equipments, purchased in France and
England, safely arrived; officers of
rank and talent, distinguished in former
wars, raised their banners and
mustered companies and even battalions;
and soon Cabrera was strong
enough to traverse Catalonia in all
directions, and to collect from the inhabitants
regular contributions, in
almost every instance willingly paid,
and gathered often within cannon-shot
of the enemy's forts. He seemed
ubiquitous. He was heard of everywhere,
but more rarely seen, at least
in his own character. In various assumed
ones, not unfrequently in the
garb of a priest, he accompanied small
detachments sent to collect imposts;
doing subaltern's rather than general's
duty, ascertaining by personal observation
the temper and disposition of
the peasantry, and making himself
known when a point was to be gained
by the influence of his name and presence.
His prodigious activity and
perseverance wrought miracles in a
country where those qualities by no
means abound. Doubtless he has
been well seconded, but his has been
the master-spirit. The result of his
exertions is best shown by a statement
of the present Carlist strength
in Catalonia. We have already
mentioned what it was eight or nine
months ago&mdash;a few hundred men,
half-armed and ill disciplined, wandering
amongst ravines and precipices.
At the close of 1848, the Moderado
papers, without means of obtaining
correct information, estimated
the Carlist army in Catalonia at 8000
men. The Carlists themselves, whose
present policy is rather to under-state
their strength, admitted 10,000.
Their real numbers&mdash;and the accuracy
of these statistics may be relied upon&mdash;are
12,000 bayonets and sabres,
exclusive of small guerilla parties,
known as <i>volantes</i>, and other irregulars.
A large proportion of the 12,000 are
old soldiers, who served in the last
war; and all are well armed, equipped,
and disciplined, and superior to their
opponents in power of endurance, and
of effecting those tremendous marches
for which Spanish troops are celebrated.
Regularly rationed and supplied
with tobacco, they wait cheerfully till
the military chest is in condition to
disburse arrears. The curious in costume
may like to hear something of
their appearance. The brigade under
the immediate orders of Cabrera wears
a green uniform with black facings:
Ramonet's men have dark blue jackets;
there is a corps clothed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'Anglaise</i>, in
scarlet coats and blue continuations,
which is known as Count Montemolin's
own regiment. The old <em>boina</em> or
flat cap, and a sort of light, low-crowned
shako, such as is worn by the
French in Africa, compose the convenient
and appropriate head-dress.
With the important arms of artillery
and cavalry, in which armies raised as
this one has been are apt to be deficient,
Cabrera is well provided. A
number of guns were buried and otherwise
concealed in Spain ever since the
last war, and others have been procured
from France. As to cavalry,
the want of which was so frequently
and severely felt by the Carlists during
the former struggle, the Christinos will
be surprised, one of these days, to find
how formidable a body of dragoons
their opponents can bring into the
field, although at the present moment
they have but few squadrons under
arms. Nearly four thousand horses
are distributed in various country districts,
comfortably housed in farm and
convent stables, and divided amongst
the inhabitants by twos and threes.
They are well cared for, and kept in
good condition, ready to muster and
march whenever required.</p>

<p>What the Catalonian Carlists are
now most in want of, is a centre of
operations, a strong fortress&mdash;a Morella
or a Berga&mdash;whither to retreat and
recruit when necessary. That Cabrera
feels this want is evident from the
various attempts he has made to surprise
fortified towns, with a view to
hold them against the Christinos.
Hitherto these attempts have been
unsuccessful, but we may be prepared
to hear any day of his having made
one with a different result.</p>

<p>When the general tranquillity of
Europe brought Spanish dissensions
into relief, a vast deal of romance was
written in France, Spain, and England,
in the guise of memoirs of
Cabrera, and of other distinguished
leaders of the civil war, and not a
little was swallowed by the simple as
historical fact. We remember to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
have seen the Convention of Bergara
accounted for in print by a game at
cards between Espartero and Maroto,
who, both being represented as desperate
gamblers, met at night at a
lone farm-house between their respective
lines, and played for the crown
of Spain. Espartero won; and Maroto,
more loyal as a gamester than to his
king, brought over his army to the
queen. This marvellous tale, although
not exactly vouched for in the
original English, was gravely translated
in French periodicals; and the
chances are that a portion of the
French nation believe to the present
hour that Isabella owes her crown to
a lucky hit at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monté</i>. Fables equally
preposterous have been circulated
about Cabrera. Of his personal appearance,
especially, the most absurd
accounts have been published; and
type and graver have furnished so many
fantastical and imaginary portraits of
him, that one from the life may have
its interest. Ramon Cabrera is
about five feet eight inches in height,
square built, muscular, and active.
He is rather round-shouldered; his
hair is abundant and very black; his
grayish-brown eyes must be admitted,
even by his admirers, to have a cruel
expression. His complexion is tawny,
his nose aquiline; he has nothing remarkable
or striking in his appearance,
and is neither ugly nor handsome,
but of the two may be accounted
rather good-looking than otherwise.
He has neither an assassin-scowl nor
an expression like a bilious hyena,
nor any other of the little physiognomical
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agrémens</i> with which imaginative
painters have so frequently embellished
his countenance. His character,
as well as his face, has suffered from
misrepresentation. He has been depicted
as a Nero on a small scale,
dividing his time between fiddling
and massacre. There is some exaggeration
in the statement. Unquestionably
he is neither mild nor merciful;
he has shed much blood, and has
been guilty of divers acts of cruelty,
but more of these have been attributed
to him than he ever committed. His
mother's death by Christino bullets
inspired him with a burning desire of
revenge. The system of reprisals, so
largely adopted by both sides, during
the late civil war in Spain, will account
for many of his atrocities, although
it may hardly be held to
justify them. But in the present contest
he has hitherto gone upon a
totally different plan. Mercy and
humanity seem to be his device, as
they are undoubtedly his best policy.
His aim is to win followers, by clemency
and conciliation, instead of
compelling them by intimidation and
cruelty. There is as yet no authenticated
account of an execution occurring
by his order. One man was
shot at Vich by the troops blockading
the place; but he was known as a spy,
and was twice warned not to enter the
town. He pretended to retire, made
a circuit, tried another entrance, and
met his death. As to Cabrera's having
shot four or five officers for a plot
against his life, as was recently reported
in Spanish papers, and repeated
by English ones, the tale is unconfirmed,
and has every appearance of
a fabrication. There is no doubt he
finds it necessary to keep a tight hand
over his subordinates, especially in
presence of the recent defection of
some of their number, whose treachery,
however, is not likely to be very
advantageous to the Christinos.
The troops whom Pozas, Pons,
Monserrat, and the other renegade
chiefs induced to accompany
them, have for the most part returned
to their banners, and the queen
has gained nothing but a few very
untrustworthy officers. These, by
one of the conditions of their desertion,
her generals are compelled to employ,
thus creating much discontent among
those officers of the Christino army
over whose heads the traitors are placed.
The principal traitor, General Miguel
Pons, better known as Bep-al-Oli, has
been known as a Carlist ever since the
rising in Catalonia in 1827, when he was
captured by the famous Count d'Espagne,
and was condemned to the galleys,
as was his brother Antonio Pons,
one of those whom Cabrera was lately
falsely reported to have shot. After
the death of Ferdinand, both brothers
served under their former persecutor,
who thought to extinguish their resentment
by good treatment and promotion,
in spite of which precaution
a share in his assassination is pretty
generally attributed to Antonio Pons.
Bep-al-Oli is Catalan for Joseph-in-oil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
or Oily Joe, a slippery cognomen,
which his recent change of sides
seems to justify. Still he is a model
of consistency compared to many
Spanish officers, who have changed
sides half-a-dozen times in the last
fifteen years. And, indeed, after
one-and-twenty years' stanch and
active Carlism, the sincerity of Bep's
conversion may perhaps be considered
dubious. It would be no way surprising
if he were to return to his
first love, carrying with him, of
course, the large sum for which he
was bought. Another chief, Monserrat,
passed over to the Christinos
with two or three companions, and
the very next week he had the misfortune
to fall asleep, whereupon the
better half of his band took advantage
of his slumbers to go back to their
colours, much comforted by the
gratuities they had received for changing
sides. When Monserrat awoke,
he was furious at this defection, and
instantly pursued his stray sheep.
Not having been heard of since, it is
not unlikely he may ultimately have
followed their example. Of course,
money is the means employed to
seduce these fickle partisans. They
are all bought at their own price,
which rate is generally so high as to
preclude profit. The cash-keepers at
Madrid will soon get tired of such
purchases. The regular expenses of
the war are enormous, without squandering
thousands for a few days' use
of men who cannot be depended upon.
It is notorious that immense offers
were made to Cabrera to induce him
to abandon the cause of Charles VI.,
of which he is the life and soul. Gold,
titles, rank, governorships, have been
in turn and together paraded before
him, but in vain. <em>He</em> would indeed
be worth buying, at almost any
price; for he could not be replaced,
and his loss would be a death-blow
to the Carlist cause. Knowing
this, and finding him incorruptible,
it were not surprising if certain unscrupulous
persons at Madrid sought
other means of removing him from
the scene. Cabrera, aware of the
great importance of his life, very
prudently takes his precautions. He
has done so, to some extent, at
various periods of his career. During
the early portion of his exile in
France, when that country, especially
its southern provinces, swarmed with
Spanish emigrants, many of whom
had deep motives for hating him&mdash;whilst
others, needy and starving,
and inured to crime and bloodshed,
might have been tempted to knife him
for the contents of his pockets&mdash;the
refugee chief wore a shirt of mail beneath
his sheepskin jacket. He had
also a celebrated pair of leathern
trousers, which were generally believed
to have a metallic lining.
And, at the present time, report says
that his head is the only vulnerable
part of his person.</p>

<p>In presence of their Catalonian
anxieties, of Cabrera's rapidly increasing
strength, and of the impotence
of Christino generals, who
start for the insurgent districts with
premature vaunts of their triumphs,
and return to Madrid, baffled and
crestfallen, to wrangle in the senate
and divulge state secrets&mdash;the Narvaez
government is secretly most
anxious to make up its differences
with England. This anxiety has been
made sufficiently manifest by the
recent discussions in the Cortes.
Notwithstanding his assumed indifference
and vain-glorious self-gratulation,
the Duke of Valencia would
gladly give a year's salary, perquisites,
and plunder, to recall the impolitic act
by which a British envoy was expelled
the Spanish capital. Señor
Cortina, the Progresista deputy, after
denying that there were sufficient
grounds for Sir Henry Bulwer's dismissal,
and lamenting the rupture
that has been its consequence, politely
advised Narvaez to resign office, as
almost the only means of repairing
the dangerous breach. The recommendation,
of course, was purely
ironical. General Narvaez is the
last man to play the Curtius, and
plunge, for his country's sake, into the
gulf of political extinction. In his
scale of patriotism, the good of Spain
is secondary to the advantage of
Ramon Narvaez. We can imagine
the broad grins of the Opposition, and
the suppressed titter of his own
friends, upon his having the face to
declare, that, when the French Revolution
broke out, he was actually
planning a transfer of the reins of
government into the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Progresistas. The bad example of
democratic France frustrated his disinterested
designs, changed his benevolent
intentions, and compelled him
to transport and imprison, by wholesale,
the very men towards whom, a
few weeks previously, he was so magnanimously
disposed. Returns of
more than fifteen hundred persons,
thus arbitrarily torn from their homes
and families, were moved for early in
the session; but only the names were
granted, the charges against them
being kept secret, in order not to give
the lie to the ministerial assertion
that but a small minority were condemned
for political offences. As to
the dispute with England, although
Narvaez' pride will not suffer him to
admit his blunder and his regrets,
many of his party make no secret of
their desire for a reconciliation at any
price; fondly believing, perhaps, that
it would be followed, upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amantium
iræ</i> principle, by warmer love
and closer union than before. The
slumbers of these <i>ojalatero</i> politicians
are haunted by sweet visions of a
British steam-flotilla cruising off the
Catalonian coast, of Carlist supplies
intercepted, of British batteries mounted
on the shores of Spain, and manned
by British marines&mdash;the sight of
whose red jackets might serve, at a
pinch, to bolster up the wavering
courage of a Christino division&mdash;and
of English commodores and artillery-colonels
supplying such deficient
gentlemen as Messrs Cordova and
Concha with the military skill which,
in Spain, is by no means an indispensable
qualification for a lieutenant-general's
commission. Doubtless, if the
alliance between Lord Palmerston and
Queen Christina had continued, we
should have had something of this
sort, some more petty intermeddling
and minute military operations, consumptive
of English stores, and discreditable
to English reputation. As
it is, there seems a chance of the
quarrel being fairly fought out; of
the Spaniards being permitted to
settle amongst themselves a question
which concerns themselves alone. If
the Carlists get the better of the
struggle, (and it were unsafe to give
long odds against them,) it is undeniable
that they began with small resources,
and that their triumph will
have been achieved by their own
unaided pluck and perseverance.</p>

<p>Puzzled how to make his peace
with England, without too great mortification
to his vanity and too great
sacrifice of what he calls his dignity,
Narvaez falls back upon France, and
does his best to curry favour there by
a fulsome acknowledgment of the
evils averted from Spain by the
friendly offices of Messrs Lamartine
and Bastide, and of "the illustrious
General Cavaignac." The fact is,
that during the first six months of the
republic, nobody in France had leisure
to give a thought to Spain, and Carlists
and Progresistas were allowed
to concert plans and make purchases
in France without the slightest molestation.
At last, General Cavaignac,
worried by Sotomayor&mdash;and partly,
perhaps, through sympathy with his
brother-dictator, Narvaez&mdash;sent to
the frontier one Lebrière, a sort of
thieftaker or political Vidocq, who
already had been similarly employed
by Louis Philippe. This man was to
stir up the authorities and thwart the
Carlists, and at first he did hamper
the latter a little; but whether it was
that he was worse paid than on his
former mission&mdash;Cavaignac's interest
in the affair being less personal than
that of the King of the French&mdash;or
that some other reason relaxed his
activity, he did not long prove efficient.
Then came the elections, and
the success of Louis Napoleon was
unwelcome intelligence to the Madrid
government&mdash;it being feared that old
friendship might dispose him to favour
Count Montemolin as far as lay in his
power: whereupon&mdash;the influence of
woman being a lever not unnaturally
resorted to by a party which owes its
rise mainly to bedchamber intrigue
and to the patronage of Madame
Muñoz&mdash;the notable discovery was
made that the Duchess of Valencia (a
Frenchwoman by birth) is a connexion
of the Buonaparte family, and
her Grace was forthwith despatched
to Paris to exercise her coquetries and
fascinations upon her far-off cousin,
and to intrigue, in concert with the
Duke of Sotomayor, for the benefit
of her husband's government. The
result of her mission is not yet apparent.
Putting all direct intervention
completely out of the question, France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
has still a vast deal in her power in
all cases of insurrection in the northern
and eastern provinces of Spain.
A sharp look-out on the frontier,
seizure of arms destined for the insurgents,
and the removal of Spanish
refugees to remote parts of France,
are measures that would greatly harass
and impede Carlist operations; much
less so now, however, than three or
four months ago. Most of the emigrants
have now entered Spain; and
horses and arms&mdash;the latter in large
numbers&mdash;have crossed the frontier.</p>

<p>Up to the middle of January, the
Montemolinist insurrection was confined
to Catalonia, where alone the
insurgents were numerous and organised.
This apparent inactivity in
other districts, where a rising might
be expected, was to be attributed to
the season. The quantity of snow
that had fallen in the northern provinces
was a clog upon military operations.
About the middle of the
month, a thousand men, including three
hundred cavalry, made their appearance
in Navarre, headed by Colonel
Montero, an old and experienced officer
of the peninsular war, who served on the
staff so far back as the battle of Baylen.
This force is to serve as a nucleus.
The conscription for 1849 has been
anticipated; that is to say, the young
soldiers who should have joined their
colours at the end of the year, are
called for at its commencement; and
it is expected that many of these conscripts,
discontented at the premature
summons, will prefer joining the Carlists.
When the weather clears, it is
confidently anticipated that two or
three thousand hardy recruits will
make the valleys of Biscay and Navarre
ring once more with their Basque
war-cries, headed by men whose
names will astonish those who still
discredit the virtual union of Carlists
and Progresistas.</p>

<p>The masses of troops sent into
Catalonia have as yet effected literally
nothing, not having been able to prevent
the enemy even from recruiting
and organising. General Cordova
made a military promenade, lost a few
hundred men&mdash;slain or taken prisoners
with their brigadier at their head&mdash;and
resigned the command. He has
been succeeded by Concha, a somewhat
better soldier than Cordova, who
was never anything but a parade
butterfly of the very shallowest capacity.
Concha has as yet done little more
than his predecessor, (his reported
victory over Cabrera between Vich
and St Hippolito was a barefaced invention,
without a shadow of foundation,)
although his force is larger than Cordova's
was, and his promises of what
he <em>would</em> do have been all along most
magnificent. Already there has been
talk of his resignation, which doubtless
will soon occur, and Villalonga is
spoken of to succeed him. This general,
lately created Marquis of the Maestrazgo
for his cruelty and oppression
of the peasantry in that district, will
hardly win his dukedom in Catalonia,
although dukedoms in Spain are now to
be had almost for the asking. Indeed,
they have become so common that,
the other day, General Narvaez,
Duke of Valencia, anxious for distinction
from the vulgar herd, was about
to create himself prince; but having
unfortunately selected Concord for his
intended title, and the accounts from
Catalonia being just then anything
but peaceable, he was fain to postpone
his promotion till it should be more
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de circonstance</i>. The Prince of Concord
would be a worthy successor to
the Prince of the Peace. Spain was
once proud of her nobility and choice
of her titles. Alas! how changed are
the times! What a pretty list of
grandees and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">titulos de Castilla</i> the
Spanish peerage now exhibits! Mr
Sotomayor, the other day a bookseller's
clerk, then sub-secretary in a
ministry, then understrapper to Gonzales
Bravo, now duke and ambassador
at Paris! What a successor
to the princely and magnificent envoys
of a Philip and a Charles!
And Mr Sartorius, lately a petty
jobber on the Madrid Bolsa, is now
Count of St Louis, secretary of state,
&amp;c.! When the Legion of Honour
was prostituted in France by lavish
and indiscriminate distribution, and
by conversion into an electioneering
bribe and a means of corruption, many
old soldiers, who had won their cross
upon the battle-fields of the Empire,
had the date of its bestowal affixed
in silver figures to their red ribbon.
The old nobility of Spain must soon
resort to a similar plan, and sign their
date of creation after their names, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
they would be distinguished from the
horde of disreputable adventurers on
whom titles have of late years been
infamously squandered.</p>

<p>When the Madrid government has
performed its promise, so often repeated
during the last six months, of
extinguishing the Carlists and restoring
peace to Spain, we hope those ill-treated
gentlemen in the city of London,
who, from time to time, draw up
a respectful representation to General
Narvaez on the subject of Spanish
debts&mdash;a representation which that
officer blandly receives, and takes an
early opportunity of forgetting&mdash;will
pluck up courage and sternly urge the
Duke of Valencia and the finance
minister of the day to apply to the
liquidation of Spanish bondholders'
claims a part, at least, of the resources
now expended on military operations.
Forty-five millions of reals, about
half-a-million of pounds sterling, are
now, we are credibly informed, the
monthly expenditure of the war department
of Spain. That this is
squeezed out of the country, by some
means or other, is manifest, since nobody
now lends money to Spain. A
very large part of this very considerable
sum being expended in Catalonia,
goes into the pockets of the inhabitants
of that province, who pay it
over to the Carlists in the shape of
contributions, and still make a profit
by the transaction&mdash;so that they are
in no hurry to finish the war; and
Catalonia presents at this moment
the singular spectacle of two contending
armies paid out of the same military
chest. But Spain is the country
of anomalies; and nothing in the conduct
of Spaniards will ever surprise us,
until we find them, by some extraordinary
chance, conducting their affairs
according to the rules of common
sense and the dictates of ordinary
prudence.</p>

especially to the Circassians, because they are regarded (in Urquhart's words) 'as
the only people, from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, ever ready to revenge an
injury and retort a menace proceeding from the Czar of the Muscovites.' Urquhart's
opinion, which is shared by the great majority of the European public, is not
quite correct, the Circassians not being the only combatants against Russia. Indeed
it so happens that, for the last four years, they have kept tolerably quiet in their
mountains, contenting themselves with small forays into the Cossack country on the
Kuban; whilst the warlike Tshetshens in the eastern Caucasus, their chief, Chamyl,
at their head, have given the Russian army much more to do. But, in the absence of
official intelligence, and of regular newspaper information concerning the events of
the war, people in Europe have got accustomed to admire and praise the Circassians
as the only defenders of Caucasian freedom against Russian aggression; and
even in St Petersburg the intelligent public hold the famous Chamyl to be chief
of the Circassians, with whom he has nothing whatever to do."&mdash;<cite>Der Kaukasus</cite>,

in thirst for distinction, and in honourable ambition, to awaken and stimulate which,
innumerable means are employed. In no other army are the rewards for those officers
who distinguish themselves in the field of so many kinds, and so lavishly dealt
out. There are all manner of medals and marks for good service&mdash;crosses and stars of
Saints George, Stanislaus, Vladimir, Andrew, Anna, and other holy personages; some
with crowns, some with diamonds, peculiar distinctions on the epaulets and uniforms,
&amp;c. &amp;c. I was once in a distinguished society, composed almost entirely of officers
of the army of the Caucasus. Not finding very much amusement, I had the patience to
count all the orders and decorations in the room, and found that upon the breasts of
the thirty-five military guests, there glittered more than two hundred stars, crosses,
and medals; on some of the generals' coats were more orders than buttons. As it
usually happens, the desire for these distinctions increases with their possession.
The Russian who has obtained a medal leaves no stone unturned to get a knight's
cross, and when the cross is at his button-hole, he is ravenous for the glittering star,
and ready to make any sacrifice to obtain it."&mdash;<cite>Der Kaukasus</cite>, &amp;c., vol. ii. p. 98.</p></div>
